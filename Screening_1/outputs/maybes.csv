7887726f5a97f696,A Bayesian approach to term structure modeling using heavy-tailed distributions,"In this paper, we introduce a robust extension of the three-factor model of Diebold and Li (J. Econometrics, 130: 337-364, 2006) using the class of symmetric scale mixtures of normal distributions. Specific distributions examined include the multivariate normal, Student-t, slash, and variance gamma distributions. In the presence of non-normality in the data, these distributions provide an appealing robust alternative to the routine use of the normal distribution. Using a Bayesian paradigm, we developed an efficient MCMC algorithm for parameter estimation. Moreover, the mixing parameters obtained as a by-product of the scale mixture representation can be used to identify outliers. Our results reveal that the Diebold-Li models based on the Student-t and slash distributions provide significant improvement in in-sample fit and out-of-sample forecast to the US yield data than the usual normal-based model.

3cf2316bbcf2ce76,A Hybrid Vector Autoregressive Model for Accurate Macroeconomic Forecasting: An Application to the U.S. Economy,"Forecasting macroeconomic variables is essential to macroeconomics, financial economics, and monetary policy analysis. Due to the high dimensionality of the macroeconomic dataset, it is challenging to forecast efficiently and accurately. Thus, this study provides a comprehensive analysis of predicting macroeconomic variables by comparing various vector autoregressive models followed by different estimation techniques. To address this, this paper proposes a novel hybrid model based on a smoothly clipped absolute deviation estimation method and a vector autoregression model that combats the curse of dimensionality and simultaneously produces reliable forecasts. The proposed hybrid model is applied to the U.S. quarterly macroeconomic data from the first quarter of 1959 to the fourth quarter of 2023, yielding multi-step-ahead forecasts (one-, three-, and six-step ahead). The multi-step-ahead out-of-sample forecast results (root mean square error and mean absolute error) for the considered data suggest that the proposed hybrid model yields a highly accurate and efficient gain. Additionally, it is demonstrated that the proposed models outperform the baseline models. Finally, the authors believe the proposed hybrid model may be expanded to other countries to assess its efficacy and accuracy.",,2025,10.3390/math13111706,,proquest,"This study proposes a novel hybrid vector autoregressive (VAR) model using a smoothly clipped absolute deviation estimation method for accurate macroeconomic forecasting.

78921cc3f5612ddb,A re-evaluation of the term spread as a leading indicator,"Forecasting the evolution path of macroeconomic variables has always been of keen interest to policy makers and market participants. A common tool used in the relevant forecasting literature is the term spread of Treasury bond yields. In this paper, we decompose the term spread into an expectation and a term premium component and evaluate the informational content of each component in forecasting the GDP growth rate and inflation in various forecasting horizons. In doing so, we employ alternative decomposition procedures and introduce the Support Vector Regression (SVR) methodology from the field of Machine Learning, coupled with linear and non-linear kernels as a novel forecasting method in the field. Using rolling windows in producing point and conditional probability distribution forecasts we find that neither the term spread, nor its decomposition components possess the ability to accurately forecast output growth or inflation. Our findings extend the existing literature, since they are focused on an explicit out-of-sample evaluation in contrast to most existing empirical studies that produce only in-sample forecasts. To strengthen our findings, we also consider several control variables suggested in the relevant literature without significant qualitative differences from the initial results.

Containing a core curve and multiple peripheral curves, the yield net is spanned by three layers of factors: base factors spanning all curves, and common and individual spread factors.

9cf59f608ef4415d,Autoencoder-Based Three-Factor Model for the Yield Curve of Japanese Government Bonds and a Trading Strategy,"Interest rates are representative indicators that reflect the degree of economic activity. The yield curve, which combines government bond interest rates by maturity, fluctuates to reflect various macroeconomic factors. Central bank monetary policy is one of the significant factors influencing interest rate markets. Generally, when the economy slows down, the central bank tries to stimulate the economy by lowering the policy rate to establish an environment in which companies and individuals can easily raise funds. In Japan, the shape of the yield curve has changed significantly in recent years following major changes in monetary policy. Therefore, an increasing need exists for a model that can flexibly respond to the various shapes of yield curves. In this research, we construct a three-factor model to represent the Japanese yield curve using the machine learning approach of an autoencoder. In addition, we focus on the model parameters of the intermediate layer of the neural network that constitute the autoencoder and confirm that the three automatically generated factors represent the “Level,” “Curvature,” and “Slope” of the yield curve.

d398e1bb9cf578bc,Iterative and Recursive Estimation in Structural Nonadaptive Models,"An inference method, called latent backfitting, is proposed. This method appears well suited for econometric models where the structural relationships of interest define the observed endogenous variables as a known function of unobserved state variables and unknown parameters. This nonlinear state-space specification paves the way for iterative or recursive EM-like strategies. In the E steps, the state variables are forecasted given the observations and a value of the parameters. In the M steps, these forecasts are used to deduce estimators of the unknown parameters from the statistical model of latent variables. The proposed iterative/recursive estimation is particularly useful for latent regression models and for dynamic equilibrium models involving latent state variables.

3dc61fee5d9bbaf9,Purebred or hybrid?: Reproducing the volatility in term structure dynamics,"This paper investigates the ability of mixtures of affine, quadratic, and non-linear models to track the volatility in the term structure of interest rates. Term structure dynamics appear to exhibit pronounced time varying or stochastic volatility. Ahn et al. (Rev. Financial Stud. xx (2001) xxx) provide evidence suggesting that term structure models incorporating a set of quadratic factors are better able to reproduce term structure dynamics than affine models, although neither class of models is able to fully capture term structure volatility. In this study, we combine affine, quadratic and non-linear factors in order to maximize the ability of a term structure model to generate heteroskedastic volatility. We show that this combination entails a tradeoff between specification of heteroskedastic volatility and correlations among the factors. By combining factors, we are able to gauge the cost of this tradeoff. Using efficient method of moments (Gallant and Tauchen, Econometric Theory 12 (1996) 657), we find that augmenting a quadratic model with a non-linear factor results in improvement in fit over a model comprised solely of quadratic factors when the model only has to confront first and second moment dynamics. When the full dynamics are confronted, this result reverses. Since the non-linear factor is characterized by stronger dependence of volatility on the level of the factor, we conclude that flexibility in the specification of both level dependence and correlation structure of the factors are important for describing term structure dynamics. © 2003 Elsevier B.V.

However, previous studies have faced challenges in extracting hidden factors related to gold price prediction from diverse economic indicators, and the comprehensive exploration of gold price data is yet to be fully achieved. To address this, the present study introduces a mid to long-term gold price prediction model named DPformer. This model utilizes a patching strategy to investigate the relationships between different economic indicators and Gold Prices. It also employs a decomposition approach to discover the mid to long-term trend characteristics and yearly seasonal patterns of Gold Prices. The core of the model integrates a Transformer module, which is solely based on an Encoder structure, and enhances it with multiple attention mechanisms and convolutions. This enhancement allows the improved Transformer model to more effectively capture the long-term dependencies of Gold Prices. The empirical results demonstrate that DPformer consistently outperforms a suite of advanced models widely adopted in terms of mid to long-term forecasting accuracy, including LSTM, GRU, Transformer, DLinear, and PatchTST. Notably, for the 30-step gold price prediction task, DPformer achieves a 21.78 % reduction in Mean Squared Error compared to PatchTST.

In this paper we evaluate nonlinear machine learning and econometric methodologies in forecasting US inflation based on autoregressive and structural models of the term structure. We employ two nonlinear methodologies: the econometric least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) and the machine-learning support vector regression (SVR) method. The SVR has never been used before in inflation forecasting considering the term spread as a regressor. In doing so, we use a long monthly dataset spanning the period 1871:1-2015:3 that covers the entire history of inflation in the US economy. For comparison purposes we also use ordinary least squares regression models as a benchmark. In order to evaluate the contribution of the term spread in inflation forecasting in different time periods, we measure the out-of-sample forecasting performance of all models using rolling window regressions. Considering various forecasting horizons, the empirical evidence suggests that the structural models do not outperform the autoregressive ones, regardless of the model's method.

f74524ca4a843b41,Equity/bond yield correlation and the FED model: evidence of switching behaviour from the G7 markets,"This paper considers how the strength and nature of the relation between the equity and bond yield varies with the level of the real bond yield. We demonstrate that at low levels of the real bond yield, the correlation between the equity and bond yields turns negative. This arises as the lower bond yield implies heightened macroeconomic risk (e.g. deflation and economic stagnation) and causes equity and bond prices to move in opposite directions. The FED model relies on a positive relation for its success in predicting future returns. Thus, we argue that the mixed empirical evidence regarding the FED model arises due to this switch in correlation behaviour. We present supportive evidence for the switching relation and its link to the level of the bond yield using linear and nonlinear smooth transition panel regression techniques for the G7 markets. The results presented here should be of interest to market practitioners who may wish to use the FED model to aid market timing decisions and for academics interested in understanding the interrelations between markets. © 2018 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Humpe, A.; McMillan, D.G.",2018,10.1057/s41260-018-0091-x,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85052958299&doi=10.1057%2Fs41260-018-0091-x&partnerID=40&md5=da878cf9fc2d0e5c1d3d00c3aa2fbdb2,scopus,"This paper investigates the relationship between equity and bond yields, finding that it becomes negative at low real bond yield levels due to heightened macroeconomic risk.

The goal of this article is to estimate interest rate curves by using Support Vector Regression (SVR), a method derived from the Statistical Learning Theory developed by Vapnik (1995). The motivation is that SVR features these extra capabilities at a low estimation cost. The SVR is specified by a loss function, a kernel function and a smoothing parameter. SVR models the daily U.S. dollar interest rate swap curves, from 1997 to 2001. As expected from a priori and sensibility analyses, the SVR equipped with the kernel generating a spline with an infinite number of nodes was the best performing SVR. Comparing this SVR with other models, it achieved the best cross-validation interpolation performance in controlling the bias-variance trade-off and generating the lowest error considering the desired accuracy fixed by the bid-ask spreads.","Monteiro, Andre d'Almeida",2010,10.1080/07474938.2010.481998,,wos,"This article estimates interest rate curves using Support Vector Regression (SVR), a method that incorporates bid-ask spreads and restricts curve shape.

6eebbf4ce06ab357,A static replication approach for callable interest rate derivatives: mathematical foundations and efficient estimation of SIMM–MVA,"The computation of credit risk measures such as exposure and Credit Value Adjustments (CVA) requires the simulation of future portfolio prices. Recent metrics, such as dynamic Initial Margin (IM) and Margin Value Adjustments (MVA) additionally require the simulation of future conditional sensitivities. For portfolios with non-linear instruments that do not admit closed-form valuation formulas, this poses a significant computational challenge. This problem is addressed by proposing a static replication algorithm for interest rate options with early-exercise features under an affine term-structure model. Under the appropriate conditions, we can find an equivalent portfolio of vanilla options that replicate these products. Specifically, we decompose the product into a portfolio of European swaptions. The weights and strikes of the portfolio are obtained by regressing the target option value with interpretable, feed-forward neural networks. Once an equivalent portfolio of European swaptions is determined, we can leverage on closed-form expressions to obtain the conditional prices and sensitivities, which serve as an input to exposure and SIMM-driven MVA quantification. For a consistent forward sensitivity estimation, this involves the differentiation of the portfolio-weights. The accuracy and convergence of the method is demonstrated through several representative numerical examples, benchmarked against the established least-square Monte Carlo method. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Hoencamp, J.H.; Jain, S.; Kandhai, B.D.",2024,10.1080/14697688.2024.2312523,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85185970359&doi=10.1080%2F14697688.2024.2312523&partnerID=40&md5=e658f86122a239c289b291ec3fe810ae,scopus,"This paper proposes a static replication method for valuing callable interest rate derivatives and estimating SIMM-MVA.

08de1ecc4154ae9b,An analysis of nonlinearities in term premiums and forward rates,"Previous studies often assume a linear relation between term premiums on Treasury securities and forward interest rates even though a nonlinear relation is a theoretical and an empirical possibility. To examine the relation, this paper uses a nonparametric kernel approach that permits both linear and nonlinear associations. The linear specification yields conditional expectations of term premiums that are similar to those predicted by the kernel approach only at the mean forward premiums. Generally, kernel estimation shows that the responses of expected term premiums to changes in forward premiums are time-varying and are significantly different from the constant slope coefficients produced by linear estimations. The evidence also shows that forward premiums contain much more information content for predicting future term premiums than has been found with linear estimation procedures. © 2005 Elsevier Science B.V., Amsterdam.

01f7b4f943c3d0b7,An estimation model for the term structure of yield spread,"An estimation model for term structure of yield spread has become an extremely important subject to evaluate securities with default risk. By Duffie and Singleton model, yield spread was explained by two factors, namely collection rate and default probability. An estimation of the collection rate is given from historical earnings data, but estimation of default probability is known to be a remaining problem. There are some approaches to express default probability. One of them is to describe it through hazard process, and the other is to represent it by risk neutral transition probability matrix of credit-rating class. Some models that use Gaussian type hazard process or Vasicek type hazard process have already constructed. An advantage of evaluation using a rating transition probability matrix is that it is easy to obtain an image of movement of the credit-rating class. We do not need to show the calculation basis of the threshold or an assumption for distribution of prospective yield spread. But the model that uses the risk neutral transition probability matrix has not established yet, because of the computational difficulty required to estimate large number of the parameters. At first, for the purposes of this article, we will estimate the term structure of credit spreads results from the possibility of future defaults. It is assumed that credit risk is specified as a discrete-state Markov chain. And we construct a model which can be used to estimate the baseline transition matrix of the credit-rating class, risk-adjusting factors, industrial drift factors, corporate drift factors and recovery ratio, from yield spreads for individual bond. This enables us to compute the implied term structure from market data. We are capable of computing the implied term structure from market date by this process.

Our aim is to illustrate empirically a net of interactions existing among the major bond markets of Europe and the US market taking into account shifts in the underlying stochastic processes. For this purpose, differing from the rest of the relevant empirical literature, after specifying the long run equilibrium relations, we estimate the linkages between the bond markets as subject to hidden Markov chains, by applying the Markov Switching Vector Error Correction framework (MS-VECM). This formulation is found to efficiently reflect the shifts brought about by significant economic events, such as the European monetary unification. As a result we illustrate different short-run relations referring to the periods before and after the monetary union. Overall, our empirical results indicate that stronger interactions among the markets of the system exist in the period after the EMU.

Empirical evidence from an explicitly solvable stochastic volatility model,"The profound financial crisis generated by the collapse of Lehman Brothers and the European sovereign debt crisis in 2011 have caused negative values of government bond yields both in the USA and in the EURO area. This paper investigates whether the use of models which allow for negative interest rates can improve option pricing and implied volatility forecasting. This is done with special attention to foreign exchange and index options. To this end, we carried out an empirical analysis on the prices of call and put options on the US S&P 500 index and Eurodollar futures using a generalization of the Heston model in the stochastic interest rate framework. Specifically, the dynamics of the option’s underlying asset is described by two factors: a stochastic variance and a stochastic interest rate. The volatility is not allowed to be negative, but the interest rate is. Explicit formulas for the transition probability density function and moments are derived. These formulas are used to estimate the model parameters efficiently. Three empirical analyses are illustrated.

Methodology/approach - To test this hypothesis, the chapter uses the residuals of the trend relationship among housing wealth and labor income to predict both stock returns and government bond yields. Specifically, it shows that nonlinear deviations of housing wealth from its cointegrating relationship with labor income, hwy, forecast expected future returns. Findings - Using data for a set of industrialized countries, the chapter finds that when the housing wealth-to-income ratio falls, investors demand a higher risk premium for stocks. As for government bond returns: (i) when they are seen as a component of asset wealth, investors react in the same manner and (ii) if, however, investors perceive the increase in government bond returns as signaling a future rise in taxes or a deterioration of public finances, then they interpret the fall in the housing wealth-to-income ratio as a fall in future bond premia. Finally, this work shows that the occurrence of crisis episodes amplifies the transmission of housing market shocks to financial markets. Originality/value of chapter - These findings are novel.

The analysis has been carried out for individual countries and in a multivariate framework. It enables to identify systemically important countries in both markets. The USA, Switzerland, Australia, South Korea and Russia are of particular significance in the interbank lending market.

We show that the conventional results in Johansen (1996) for the maximum likelihood estimators and associated likelihood ratio tests derived under homoskedasticity do not in general hold under heteroskedasticity. As a result, standard confidence intervals and hypothesis tests on these coefficients are potentially unreliable. Solutions based on Wald tests (using a sandwich estimator of the variance matrix) and on the use of the wild bootstrap are discussed. These do not require the practitioner to specify a parametric model for volatility. We establish the conditions under which these methods are asymptotically valid. A Monte Carlo simulation study demonstrates that significant improvements in finite sample size can be obtained by the bootstrap over the corresponding asymptotic tests in both heteroskedastic and homoskedastic environments.

Automatic procedures to upgrade or downgrade risk exposure could potentially improve long term performance for such products. The risk and return of bonds is more easy to predict than the risk and return of stocks. This and the well known stock-bond correlation motivates the inclusion of the current bond yield in a model for the prediction of excess stock returns. Here, we take the actuarial long term view using yearly data, and focus on nonlinear relationships between a set of covariates. We employ fully nonparametric models and apply for estimation a local-linear kernel smoother. Since the current bond yield is not known, it is predicted in a prior step.

A Bayesian approach to SVR is discussed, and implemented. It is found that the direct implementation of the probabilistic framework of Gao et al. returns unsatisfactory results in our experiments.

It is shown that the generalization performance of this parameter selection process can reach or sometimes surpass the computationally expensive cross-validation procedure. An adaptive calibration process is also described to allow practical use of the prediction uncertainty estimates to assess the quality of predictions.

Our diffusion indexes are constructed using principal component analysis with both targeted and untargeted predictors, with targeting done using the lasso and elastic net. Our findings can be summarized as follows. First, the marginal predictive content of real‐time diffusion indexes is significant for the preponderance of the individual models that we examine. The exception to this finding is the post “Great Recession” period. Second, forecast combinations that include only yield variables result in our most accurate predictions, for most sample periods and maturities. In this case, diffusion indexes do not have marginal predictive content for yields and do not seem to reflect unspanned risks. This points to the continuing usefulness of DNS and NSS models that are purely yield driven. Finally, we find that the use of fully revised macroeconomic data may have an important confounding effect upon results obtained when forecasting yields, as prior research has indicated that diffusion indexes are often useful for predicting yields when constructed using fully revised data, regardless of whether forecast combination is used, or not.

We capture trends in the yield spread by considering both the level of the yield spread at a lag of 12 months as well as its value at each of the previous two quarters leading up to the forecast origin, and we evaluate its predictive abilities using both logit and artificial neural network models. Our results indicate that models incorporating information from the time series of the yield spread correctly predict future recession periods much better than models only considering the spread value as of the forecast origin.

It differs from recent papers investigating analogous issues because it uses Nelson's result that Garch schemes are approximations of the kind of differential equations typically employed in finance to describe the evolution of asset prices. This feature of Garch schemes usually has been overshadowed by their well-known role as simple econometric tools providing reliable estimates of unobserved conditional variances. We show instead that the diffusion approximation property of Garch gives good results and can be extended to situations with (i) non-standard distributions for the innovations of a conditional mean equation of asset price changes and (ii) volatility concepts different from the variance.

88ec6de29272b73e,Term structure estimation with liquidity-adjusted Affine Nelson Siegel model: A nonlinear state space approach applied to the Indian bond market,"Efficient term structure estimation in emerging markets is difficult not only because of overall lack of liquidity, but also because of the concentration of liquidity in a few securities. Using the arbitrage-free Affine Nelson-Siegel model, we explicitly incorporate this phenomenon using a proxy for liquidity based on observable data in the bond pricing function and estimate the term structure for Indian Government bond markets in a nonlinear state space setting using the Unscented Kalman Filter. We find strong empirical evidence in support of the extended model with both i) a better in-sample fit to bond prices, and ii) the likelihood ratio test rejecting the restrictions assumed in the standard AFNS specification. In an alternative specification, we also model liquidity as a latent risk factor within the AFNS framework. The estimated latent liquidity factor is found to be strongly correlated with the standard market benchmarks of overall liquidity and the India VIX index.",,2022,10.1080/00036846.2021.1967866,,proquest,This study estimates the term structure of the Indian bond market using a liquidity-adjusted Affine Nelson-Siegel model within a nonlinear state space framework.

045ccef9485f38e1,Testing the empirical performance of stochastic volatility models of the short-term interest rate,"I introduce two-factor discrete time stochastic volatility models of the short-term interest rate to compare the relative performance of existing and alternative empirical specifications. I develop a nonlinear asymmetric framework that allows for comparisons of non-nested models featuring conditional heteroskedasticity and sensitivity of the volatility process to interest rate levels. A new class of stochastic volatility models with asymmetric drift and nonlinear asymmetric diffusion process is introduced in discrete time and tested against the popular continuous time and symmetric and asymmetric GARCH models. The existing models are rejected in favor of the newly proposed models because of the asymmetric drift of the short rate, and the presence of nonlinearity, asymmetry, GARCH, and level effects in its volatility. I test the predictive power of nested and non-nested models in capturing the stochastic behavior of the risk-free rate.

The short-term interest rate follows a self-exciting threshold autoregressive (SETAR) process that allows for shifts in the intercept and the variance. In comparison with a linear model, we find empirical evidence in favour of the threshold model for Germany and the US. Based on the estimated short-rate dynamics we derive the implied arbitrage-free term structure of interest rates. Since analytical solutions are not feasible, bond prices are computed by means of Monte Carlo integration. The resulting term structure captures stylized facts of the data.

Cross-quantilogram analysis reveals a nonlinear dependency across adjacent periods, with stronger connectedness observed in the tail distribution than in the middle. Additionally, the functional quantile autoregression model confirms the spread's nonlinear and asymmetric nature from a distributional perspective. Specifically, higher quantiles of the previous spread exert a stronger influence on the current spread, indicating a positive persistence mechanism. Conversely, lower quantiles of the previous spread negatively affect the higher quantiles of the current spread. These findings suggest that bullish market conditions tend to sustain themselves, whereas bearish conditions hinder upward momentum, underscoring the need for quantile-specific policy interventions.","Meng, Fanyu",2025,10.1016/j.frl.2025.107216,,wos,"This study uses cross-quantilogram and functional quantile autoregression to analyze the nonlinear and asymmetric relationship between the 10-year Treasury yield and the federal funds rate spread.

4e973d99311508de,Using the yield curve to forecast economic growth,"This paper finds the yield curve to have a well-performing ability to forecast the real gross domestic product growth in the USA, compared to professional forecasters and time series models. Past studies have different arguments concerning growth lags, structural breaks, and ultimately the ability of the yield curve to forecast economic growth. This paper finds such results to be dependent on the estimation and forecasting techniques employed. By allowing various interest rates to act as explanatory variables and various window sizes for the out-of-sample forecasts, significant forecasts from many window sizes can be found. These seemingly good forecasts may face issues, including persistent forecasting errors. However, by using statistical learning algorithms, such issues can be cured to some extent. The overall result suggests, by scientifically deciding the window sizes, interest rate data, and learning algorithms, many outperforming forecasts be produced for all lags from one quarter to 3 years, although some may be worse than the others due to the irreducible noise of the data.","Yang, Parley Ruogu",2020,10.1002/for.2676,,wos,"This paper investigates the predictive power of the yield curve for US real GDP growth, comparing its performance against professional forecasters and time series models.
