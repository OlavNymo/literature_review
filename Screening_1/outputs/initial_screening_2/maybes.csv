593bb4ca69c5d955,Empirical Asset Pricing via Machine Learning,"We perform a comparative analysis of machine learning methods for the canonical problem of empirical asset pricing: measuring asset risk premiums. We demonstrate large economic gains to investors using machine learning forecasts, in some cases doubling the performance of leading regression-based strategies from the literature. We identify the best-performing methods (trees and neural networks) and trace their predictive gains to allowing nonlinear predictor interactions missed by other methods. All methods agree on the same set of dominant predictive signals, a set that includes variations on momentum, liquidity, and volatility.Authors have furnished an Internet Appendix, which is available on the Oxford University Press Web site next to the link to the final published paper online.",,2020,10.1093/rfs/hhaa009,,proquest,"This paper compares machine learning methods for empirical asset pricing, specifically measuring asset risk premiums. It shows significant economic gains for investors using machine learning forecasts, outperforming traditional regression-based strategies. The study identifies trees and neural networks as top performers, attributing their success to capturing nonlinear predictor interactions. Key predictive signals identified include momentum, liquidity, and volatility.",True,False,True,gemini-2.5-flash-lite,Ulrik,M,,2025-10-24T09:49:58.864051
1783e8e530cbe052,"Factor Models, Machine Learning, and Asset Pricing","We survey recent methodological contributions in asset pricing using factor models and machine learning. We organize these results based on their primary objectives: estimating expected returns, factors, risk exposures, risk premia, and the stochastic discount factor as well as model comparison and alpha testing. We also discuss a variety of asymptotic schemes for inference. Our survey is a guide for financial economists interested in harnessing modern tools with rigor, robustness, and power to make new asset pricing discoveries, and it highlights directions for future research and methodological advances.","Giglio, Stefano; Kelly, Bryan; Xiu, Dacheng",2022,10.1146/annurev-financial-101521-104735,,wos,"This article surveys recent methodological advancements in asset pricing that utilize factor models and machine learning.

f9836cc4dd014711,A Gaussian Process of Yield Rates Calibrated with Strips,"This paper presents a Gaussian multivariate factor model of the term structure of interest rates. It shows that there exists a martingale valuation law of the factors so that the price function of a zero-coupon bond is an exponential spline. The model’s linear and Gaussian structure yields a simple model where estimation and calibration are relatively easy to do. Using yield data on stripped bonds, the spline model gives a very good approximation of the yield curve at all times. Moreover, the crucial Gaussian assumption is reasonable when modeling the dynamics for short periods like one year. © 2001 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Carrière, J.F.",2001,10.1080/10920277.2001.10595995,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85011238970&doi=10.1080%2F10920277.2001.10595995&partnerID=40&md5=b9fd767ad96ca600385575d9c079e5fb,scopus,"This paper introduces a Gaussian multivariate factor model for interest rate term structures, where bond prices are represented by exponential splines.

4414f9a04e60c0a8,Are multi-factor Gaussian term structure models still useful? An empirical analysis on Italian BTPs,"In this paper, we empirically study models for pricing Italian sovereign bonds under a reduced form framework, by assuming different dynamics for the short-rate process. We analyze classical Cox-Ingersoll-Ross and Vasicek multi-factor models, with a focus on optimization algorithms applied in the calibration exercise. The Kalman filter algorithm together with a maximum likelihood estimation method are considered to fit the Italian term-structure over a 17-year horizon, including the global financial crisis, the euro area sovereign debt crisis and the Italian political turmoil in 2018. Analytic formulas for the gradient vector and the Hessian matrix of the likelihood function are provided. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Bianchi, M.L.",2022,10.1080/03610918.2020.1721540,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85078925539&doi=10.1080%2F03610918.2020.1721540&partnerID=40&md5=48175a83feef6a419ccf98cb26d0831d,scopus,"This paper empirically analyzes multi-factor Gaussian term structure models (Cox-Ingersoll-Ross and Vasicek) for pricing Italian sovereign bonds.
