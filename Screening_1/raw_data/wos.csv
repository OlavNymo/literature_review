Numerous works have studied the behavior of sovereign bonds at the microeconomic level, given that a domestic securities market can enhance overall financial stability and improve financial market intermediation. Nevertheless, they do not deepen methods that identify liquidity risks in bond markets. This study introduces a new model for predicting unexpected situations of speculative attacks in the government bond market, applying methods of deep learning neural networks, which proactively identify and quantify financial market risks. Our approach has a strong impact in anticipating possible speculative actions against the sovereign bond market and liquidity risks, so the aspect of the potential effect on the systemic risk is of high importance.;;;;;;;;;4;0;0;0;0;0;4;;;0217-5908;1793-6837;;;;;;;;;;Univ Barcelona, Dept Business, Barcelona, SpainUniv Malaga, Dept Finance & Accounting, Malaga, SpainUniv Malaga, Catedra Econ & Finanzas Sostenibles, Malaga, Spain;;;;2022-12-02;WOS:000885903400003;;

The Gaussian shadow rate model with a linear or quadratic shadow rate is unable to explain this change in return predictability. The same holds for the quadratic term structure model and the autoregressive gamma-zero model that also enforce the ZLB. In contrast, the linear-rational square-root model explains our new empirical finding because the model allows for unspanned stochastic volatility as seen in bond yields.;;;;;;;;;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;;;0304-4076;1872-6895;;;;;;;;;;Aarhus Univ, CREATES, Aarhus, DenmarkDanish Finance Inst, Frederiksberg, DenmarkEuropean Cent Bank, Frankfurt Am Main, GermanyFed Reserve Board, Washington, DC USA;;;;2025-02-05;WOS:001409336000001;;

Unlike existing methods, our approach is especially suited for sparsely or irregularly sampled curves and for curves sampled with nonnegligible measurement error. The latent process is dynamically modeled as a functional autoregression (FAR) with Gaussian process innovations. We propose a fully nonparametric dynamic functional factor model for the dynamic innovation process, with broader applicability and improved computational efficiency over standard Gaussian process models. We prove finite-sample forecasting and interpolation optimality properties of the proposed model, which remain valid with the Gaussian assumption relaxed. An efficient Gibbs sampling algorithm is developed for estimation, inference, and forecasting, with extensions for FAR(p) models with model averaging over the lag p. Extensive simulations demonstrate substantial improvements in forecasting performance and recovery of the autoregressive surface over competing methods, especially under sparse designs. We apply the proposed methods to forecast nominal and real yield curves using daily U.S. data. Real yields are observed more sparsely than nominal yields, yet the proposed methods are highly competitive in both settings.

Using a dataset of 33,857 U.S. REIT bond yield spreads and 24 explanatory variables, we predict REIT bond yield spreads with a non-parametric artificial neural network algorithm and interpret the model's predictions using the explainable machine learning method Accumulated Local Effect Plots (ALE). We report evidence of a direct real estate factor for U.S. REIT bond yield spreads proxied by real estate market total return and REIT property type. In addition, we find a property-type diversification risk premium for REIT bonds, indicating that there is no economic benefit in the form of lower cost of bond debt for most property-type diversification at the REIT-level. We argue that this is due to higher management and valuation complexity of diversified REIT portfolios. This study's findings have relevant implications for REIT portfolio strategy and REIT capital structure decisions, as we show that specialized REITs generally have lower bond debt costs compared to diversified REITs. Moreover, a better understanding of the drivers influencing REIT bond risk premia helps investors to effectively manage bond portfolio risks.;;;;;;;;;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;;;0895-5638;1573-045X;;;;;;;;;;Univ Regensburg, Chair Real Estate Management, Int Real Estate Business Sch IREBS, Univ Str 31, D-93040 Regensburg, GermanyUniv Regensburg, Chair Stat & Risk Management, Univ Str 31, D-93040 Regensburg, GermanyFlorida Int Univ, Hollo Sch Real Estate, 1101 Brickell Ave, Miami, FL 33131 USA;;;;2025-06-16;WOS:001506948200001;;

Instead of modelling the nominal and real yields jointly, I make assumptions about the short-term inflation rate. More specifically, I assume it follows a Gaussian process. This framework has a closed-form expression for IRP. Since inflation yields are not observed, to estimate the model parameters I approximate them by the break-even inflation rate. This approximation works well because the convexity correction is very small. I find that the estimated IRP is strongly correlated with those obtained using surveys or more complex models. Therefore, I provide an easier procedure to obtain IRP, avoiding the cumbersome estimation process of high-order models.;;;;;;;;;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;;;0003-6846;1466-4283;;;;;;;;;;Cent Bank Brazil, Rio De Janeiro, Brazil;;;;2022-08-28;WOS:000843085000001;;

The bond market offers a global perspective on capital costs for a business by establishing the fair value of the bond issue, which is based on multiple factors. The asset price market, which has employed machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) techniques to address the primary forecasting difficulty, surprisingly plays a significant role in predicting future bond market returns. As an outcome, if this gap can be forecast, it can act as the bond market's data -driven long-term direction and yield additional profits. Daily securityspecific data for the 10 -to -3 -year Indian Treasury Bond (ITB) was gathered from 2013 to 2022 and is available in the global government bonds database. The researchers looked at how well the auto -regressive integrated moving average (ARIMA), linear regression, and deep recurrent neural network -long short-term memory (DLSTM) models could predict bond yields and returns in future bond markets. The empirical results demonstrate that the DLSTM models most fairly predict the price of government bonds over both the short and longer horizons when compared to ARIMA and linear regression.

It was also found that the GARCH models are conditionally efficient with respect to neural network models, but the neural network models outperform GARCH models if financial performance measures are used. In resonance with the results reported for the tests for neglected nonlinearity, it was found that the neural network forecasts are conditionally efficient with respect to linear regression models for large stocks and corporate bonds, whereas the evidence is not statistically significant for small stocks and intermediate-term government bonds.

The noisiness and non-stationarity of asset returns makes the estimation of risk premia using machine learning (ML) techniques challenging. In this work, we develop ML models that solve the problems associated with risk premia forecasting by separating risk premia prediction into two independent tasks, a time series model and a cross-sectional model, and using neural networks with skip connections to enable their deep neural network training. These models are tested robustly with different metrics, and we observe that our models outperform several existing standard ML models. A known issue with ML models is their 'black box' nature, i.e. their opaqueness to interpretability.

Two advanced methods are used: time-varying parameter models with the implementation of state space modelling using a Kalman filter and nonparametric nonlinear models with Neural Network Regression (NNR). These are benchmarked against more traditional forecasting techniques to ascertain their potential as a forecasting tool and their economic value as a base for a trading decision tool. The models were developed using data from the UK Gilt market, US T-Bond market and German Bund market. Using in-sample data from April 2001 to January 2003 to develop the models, their results were assessed using the out-of-sample period of January 2003 to June 2003. Performance evaluation was based upon forecasting accuracy measures and financial criteria using a simulated trading strategy incorporating realistic trading costs. It is concluded that for the time series studied and for the period under investigation, the performance of the advanced models is mixed. While the NNR models have the ability to forecast the 10-year Government bond yield and add economic value as a trading decision tool, the Kalman filter models' performance is not as conclusive. The Kalman filter models outperformed the traditional techniques using forecasting accuracy measures, however they did not perform as well in the simulated trading strategy.;;;;;;;;;3;0;0;0;0;0;7;;;1351-847X;1466-4364;;;;;;;;;;JMU, CIBEF Ctr Int Banking Econ & Finance, Liverpool L3 5UZ, Merseyside, EnglandLiverpool John Moores Univ, Liverpool L3 5UX, Merseyside, England;;;;2007-01-01;WOS:000208509000003;;

In contrast, this study takes the novel approach of forecasting and trading the longer-term trends (macro-cycles) of exchange rates. It proposes a unique hybrid forecast model consisting of linear regression, multilayer neural network, and combination models embedded with technical trading rules and economic fundamentals to predict the macro-cycles of the selected currencies and investigate the predicative power and market timing ability of the model. The results confirm that the combination model has a significant predictive power and market timing ability, and outperforms the benchmark models in terms of returns. The finding that the government bond yield differentials and CPI differentials are the important factors in exchange rate forecasts further implies that interest rate parity and PPP have strong influence on foreign exchange market participants.;;;;;;;;;1;0;0;0;0;0;1;;;;2071-1050;;;;;;;;;;Natl Univ Singapore, Dept Econ, Singapore 119077, SingaporeEdith Cowan Univ, Sch Business & Law, Perth, WA 6000, Australia;;;;2021-09-19;WOS:000694488600001;;

In this paper, we propose a new term-structure interpolation method that extends classical spline techniques by additionally allowing for quantification of uncertainty. The proposed method is based on a generalization of kriging models with linear equality constraints (market-fit conditions) and shape-preserving conditions such as monotonicity or positivity (no-arbitrage conditions). We define the most likely curve and show how to build confidence bands. The Gaussian process co-variance hyper-parameters under the construction constraints are estimated using cross-validation techniques. Based on observed market quotes at different dates, we demonstrate the efficiency of the method by building curves together with confidence intervals for term-structures of OIS discount rates, of zero coupon swaps rates and of CDS implied default probabilities. We also show how to construct interest-rate surfaces or default probability surfaces by considering time (quotation dates) as an additional dimension. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Unlike the U.S., Korea is a small open economy characterized by highly volatile capital flows and non-reserve currency country. My empirical findings show that among alternative predictive variables (including the macro and global liquidity factors) for one-year-ahead excess bond returns, the global liquidity factors, extracted from the panel data set of various global liquidity variables, are the only predictors that perform well across both in- and out-of-sample forecast analysis. In a similar vein, the regression analysis for the determinants of the estimated bond risk premia (with both monthly and quarterly frequencies) reveals that similar to the case of U.S. bond market, the risk premia in Korean government bonds are affected by domestic expected inflation, but more importantly, that they are affected heavily by the global liquidity variables, such as VIX, bank capital flows and the leverage of global banks.

The application of PCA maximizes the explained variance of a linear combination of bond yields by selecting weights that are as uncorrelated as possible. In the context of factor construction, this choice of weights imposes orthogonality on the state variable bringing about restrictions on model estimation. We quantify the effect of these restrictions, measured through internal consistency equations, on the empirical performance of DTSM contained within linear-affine and linear-quadratic state space formulations (SSF) characterized by Gaussian and non-Gaussian transition dynamics for the state variable. When looking across DTSM, we find the smallest effect of restrictions imposed by PCA on empirical performance when it is used in the context of a linear-affine SSF, and the state transition dynamics are postulated based upon the conditional mean and variance. We also document that the magnitude of this effect is more pronounced when the probability distribution for the data is described by the first four moments relative to just the first two and the parameter dependencies defining the relationship between bond yields and factors are more analytically or computationally complicated (e.g., involves a special function like the Bessel function or cumbersome algebraic manipulations).

The previous traditional research mainly focused on the perspective of unsystematic risk. However, at present, more and more scholars are beginning to focus on systemic risks. Based on the neural network algorithm, this paper constructs an improved neural network-based corporate bond spread model to explore the impact of macro systemic risks on credit spreads. Based on the multi-factor no-arbitrage model, the linear relationship between the credit spread and the risk premium of each factor is obtained. At the same time, based on previous research results and observations of the current market reality, this paper identifies five important macroeconomic factors: actual economic output factors, inflation factors, stock market volatility factors, stock market return factors and inter-bank funding factors. The research results show that the model constructed in this paper has excellent performance.;;;;;;;;;3;0;0;0;0;0;3;;;1064-1246;1875-8967;;;;;;;;;;Xinjiang Agr Univ, Management Sch, Urumqi, Xinjiang, Peoples R China;;;;2021-05-22;WOS:000640518000079;;

We define a market state with recurrent neural network (RNN) volatility predictions and construct an investment strategy that dynamically combines equity, cash, and safe havens. The equity is allocated by targeting the volatility, and investing in safe havens depends on the predicted market state. We consider the S&P500 index with 13 safe haven assets, such as long-term government bonds, commodities, gold, and other precious metals. Other indices, NIKKEI225, NIFTY50, and STOXX50, are examined for robustness. With analysis conducted over a 20-year sample period, we find that RNN delivers sound predictions to construct the volatility targeting strategy. Among considered assets, only long-term Treasury bonds act as a safe haven and improve the strategy performance. Other considered assets have no such potential.

The main purpose of the present study is related to designing and implementation of real-time monitoring, prediction, and control system for flood disaster management as a DSS. Likewise, the problem of statement in the research is correlated to implementation of a system for different climates of Iran as a unique flood control system. For the first time, this study coupled hydrological data mining, Machine Learning (ML), and Multi-Criteria Decision Making (MCDM) as smart alarm and prevention systems. Likewise, it created the platform for conditional management of floods in Iran's different clusters of climates. According to the KMeans clustering system, which determines homogeneity of the hydrology of a specific region, Iran's rainfall is heterogeneous with 0.61 score, which is approved high efficiency of clustering in a vast country such as Iran with four seasons and different climates. In contrast, the relation of rainfall and flood disaster is evaluated by Nearest Neighbors Classification (NNC), Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD), Gaussian Process Classifier (GPC), and Neural Network (NN) algorithms which have an acceptable correlation coefficient with a mean of 0.7. The machine learning outputs demonstrated that based on valid data existence problems in developing countries, just with verified precipitation records, the flood disaster can be estimated with high efficiency. In the following, Technique for Order of Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS) method as a Game Theory (GT) technique ranked the preventive flood damages strategies through three social (Se 1), environmental (Se 2), and economic (Se 3) crises scenarios. The solutions of flood disaster management are collected from literature review, and the opinion approves them of 9 senior experts who are retired from a high level of water resource management positions of Iran. The outcomes of the TOPSIS method proved that National announcement for public-institutional participation for rapid response and funding (G1-2), Establishment of delay structures to increase flood focus time to give the animals in the ecosystem the opportunity to escape to the upstream points and to preserve the habitat (G 2-8), and Granting free national financial resources by government agencies in order to rebuild sensitive infrastructure such as railways, hospitals, schools, etc. to the provincial treasury (G3-10) are selected as the best solution of flood management in Social, Environmental, and Economic crises, respectively.

Therefore, bond rating prediction has become an interesting potential for investors and financial institutions. Previous research studies in this field have applied traditional statistical methods to develop models which provide prediction accuracy. However, no overall distinguished methods have been used in predicting bond ratings. Moreover, recent studies have suggested ensembles of classifiers that may be used in bond rating prediction. This article proposes an improved machine learning aimed to predict the rating of financial bonds. We empirically compare the classifiers ranging from logistic regression and discriminant analysis to nonparametric classifiers, such as support vector machine, neural networks, the cost-sensitive decision tree algorithm and deep neural networks. Three real-world bond rating data sets were selected to check the effectiveness and the viability of the set of the classifiers.

Competing forecasts of crude oil prices are generated from parsimonious linear models which require no parameter estimation, as well as linear and nonlinear models. Two of the linear models that we employ exploit the informational content of oil demand and the increasing correlation between oil and equity prices and are novel to the literature. The nonlinear model that we consider is an artificial neural network. More specifically, we consider a bagged neural network, a neural network trained using the genetic algorithm as well as a neural network with fuzzy logic. We find that some of the linear models outperform the random walk in terms of out-of-sample statistical forecast accuracy. Our findings also suggest that while the buy-and-hold strategy dominates some of the models in terms of dollar payoffs and risk-adjusted returns under a long-only strategy, all the models that we consider generate higher dollar payoffs than the buy-and-hold strategy under the short-only strategy.

The relationship is particularly ambiguous within a GARCH-M framework. This paper demonstrates that such a conflict can be attributed primarily to the downward bias of standard estimators that neglect additive outliers (AO) commonly observed in financial returns, and proposes a feasible estimation method (RGMME) for the GARCH-M model based upon a robust variant of the GMM. Monte Carlo experiments demonstrate that AOs cause more serious bias in the ML and GMM estimates of the relationship coefficient than previously expected. Therefore, in the presence of AOs, the RGMME appears superior to other standard estimators in terms of the root mean square error criterion. There is strong evidence favouring the RGMME over standard estimators based on its empirical application. In particular, it is substantially evident from the results of the RGMME that there is support for a positive relationship between excess returns and conditional volatility for all three major equity markets.;;;;;;;;;4;0;0;0;0;0;5;;;1469-7688;;;;;;;;;;;Dankook Univ, Dept Econ, Yongin 448701, Gyeonggi Do, South Korea;;;;2009-01-01;WOS:000263292000008;;

The sample includes Russia, Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan and Azerbaijan, since only these countries, among the CIS members, possess enough government bonds included in the global debt market. The relevance of the study is due to the increasing financial uncertainty, which attracts attention to relatively reliable means of public debt; the need to understand the functioning of debt markets against the background of anti -Russian sanctions and the increasing influence of the State. The aim of the work is to empirically verify the connectivity, integration and predictability of the government bond markets of Russia, Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan and Azerbaijan. Empirical data include daily refinancing rates of national central banks, indices of total government bond yields, G -spreads of international bonds of the countries in relation to the conditionally risk -free US bond yield curve for 2019-2023. The effects of market development features are divided into local, regional and global, such as the reaction to COVID-19 and anti -Russian sanctions after 2022. We use the following methods: dynamics analysis, correlation, factor and regression analysis. The novelty of the research lies in introducing new empirical data into scientific discourse, testing a methodology that allows us to assess the interaction of monetary policies and the functioning of government bond markets, common features and differences in the behavior of these markets before and after the imposition of sanctions against the Russian financial system. We conclude that the integration of the considered markets within the CIS is violated, which poses risks to the effective economic development of the region. We consider the relatively developed and integrated, but poorly predictable markets of Russia and Kazakhstan. Unlike Russia, Kazakhstan has more connectivity regarding its monetary policy, government bond yields and risks. The yield of Azerbaijan's government bonds is influenced by a more developed market of Kazakhstan, especially in terms of risk assessment, but the market itself is developed poorly.

A novel contribution of our paper is the use of traded currency volatility, which is directly observable in the market place, to measure expectations about the future volatility of the exchange rate. Another contribution is the explicit modelling of heterogeneous exchange rate expectations formed by forward-looking fundamentalists and backward-looking chartists. Our overall empirical evidence provides strong support for the extended nonlinear UIP model.

The forecasts were based on the out-of-sample period from January 2006 to December 2011. Compared to benchmark autoregressive (AR) models, both the DFM and ANN offer more accurate forecasts with reduced root-mean-square error (RMSE) of around 2-12 % for all variables and over all forecasting horizons. The ANN as a nonlinear combining method outperforms all linear combining methods for all variables and over all forecasting horizons. The results suggest that the ANN combining method can be used as an alternative to linear combining methods to achieve greater forecasting accuracy. The ANN combining method produces out-of-sample forecasts that are substantially more accurate with a sizeable reduction in RMSE of both the AR benchmark model and the best individual forecasting model. We attribute the superiority of the ANN combining method to its ability to capture any existing nonlinear relationship between the individual forecasts and the actual forecasting values.;;;;;;;;;8;0;0;0;0;0;9;;;0377-7332;1435-8921;;;;;;;;;;Univ KwaZulu Natal, Sch Math Stat & Comp Sci, Private Bag X01, ZA-3209 Pietermaritzburg, South Africa;;;;2016-11-30;WOS:000387345900012;;

We apply a semiparametric time-varying coefficient model to identify, to what extent an observed change in the yield spread is due to a shift in macroeconomic fundamentals or due to altering risk pricing. We find that at the beginning of EMU, the government debt level and the general investors' risk aversion had a significant impact on interest differentials. In the subsequent years, however, financial markets paid less attention to the fiscal position of a country and the safe haven status of Germany diminished in importance. By the end of 2006, two years before the fall of Lehman Brothers, financial markets began to grant Germany safe haven status again. One year later, when financial turmoil began, the market reaction to fiscal loosening increased considerably. The altering in risk pricing over time period confirms the need of time-varying coefficient models in this context. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

The relationship between the excess returns and the predicting variables is recursively modeled by a neural-network model, which is capable of performing flexible nonlinear functional approximation. The nonlinear neural-network model is found to have better in-sample fit and out-of-sample forecasts compared to its linear counterpart. Moreover, the switching portfolio based on the recursive neural-network forecasts generates higher profits with lower risks than both the buy-and-hold market portfolio and the switching portfolio based on linear recursive forecasts.;;;;;;;;;84;0;0;0;0;1;99;;;0735-0015;;;;;;;;;;;Kent State Univ, Dept Econ, Coll Business Adm, Kent, OH 44242 USA;;;;1999-10-01;WOS:000082700900003;;

Even if enhanced methods of machine learning in the literature often lead to better forecasting quality, this is not clear for small asset classes, because in small asset classes enhanced machine learning methods may potentially over-fit the in-sample data. Against this background, we compare the forecasting performance of linear regression models and enhanced machine learning methods in the market for catastrophe (CAT) bonds. We use linear regression with variable selection, penalization methods, random forests and neural networks to forecast CAT bond premia.

This article empirically assesses the role played by both macroeconomic and fiscal fundamentals, proxied by a set of European Commissions forecasts, in affecting sovereign bond yields. We look at a large panel of 25 European countries between 1992 and 2015. By means panel and time-series approaches, we find that lower short-term interest rates and better fiscal institutions tend to lower bond yields. The better the economic and fiscal outlooks going forward, the lower the yields demanded in international markets. Timing also matters: investors seem to pay more attention to forecasts the shorter the forecast horizon, and they started carrying more weight since the Global Financial Crisis. Finally, the impact of yields determinants is different across countries, being more prominent in those characterized by economic hardship conditions (Greece, Ireland, Spain, and Portugal).

Our aim is to test whether the Fama-French five-factor model augmented with a default risk factor improves the predictability of returns of portfolios sorted on the firm's characteristics as well as on industry. The default risk factor is constructed by estimating the probability of default using a hybrid version of dynamic panel probit and artificial neural network (ANN) to proxy default risk. This study also provides evidence on the temporal stability of risk premiums obtained using the Fama-MacBeth approach. Using a sample of 3,806 firm-year observations on non-financial listed companies of Pakistan over 2006-2015 we found that the augmented model performed better when tested across size-investment-default sorted portfolios. The investment factor contains some default-related information, but default risk is independently priced and bears a significantly positive risk premium. The risk premiums are also found temporally stable over the full sample and more recent sample period 2010-2015 as evidence by the Fama-MacBeth regressions. The finding suggests that the default risk factor is not a useless factor and due to mispricing, default risk anomaly prevails in the Pakistani equity market.;;;;;;;;;0;0;0;0;0;0;1;;;2288-4637;2288-4645;;;;;;;;;;Univ Karachi, Appl Econ Res Ctr, R-220 Sect 15-A-1, Karachi, PakistanInst Business Adm, Karachi, Pakistan;;;;2021-05-11;WOS:000639112300071;;

This new macro factor, termed the SAGLasso factor, is a linear combination of merely 30 selected macro variables out of 917. Furthermore, it can be decomposed into three sublevel factors: a novel housing factor, an employment factor, and an inflation factor. Importantly, the predictive power of the SAGLasso factor is robust to bond yields, namely, the SAGLasso factor is not spanned by bond yields. Moreover, we show that the unspanned variation of the SAGLasso factor cannot be attributed to yield measurement error or macro measurement error.

The answer is no. The realized volatility property of persistence is too important to leave out of a realized volatility forecasting model. However, the Principal Components Combining model is ranked very close to HAR.

In the euro area, it remained low between 2010 and 2020. The European Central Bank has even had to take action against the emergence of deflation. The situation changed significantly in 2021. Inflation jumped to levels not seen for 40 years in the EU. Our study aims to use artificial intelligence to forecast inflation. We also use artificial intelligence to forecast stock index changes. Based on the forecasts, we propose portfolio reallocation decisions to protect against inflation. The forecasting literature does not address the importance of structural breaks in the time series, which, among other things, can affect both the pattern recognition and prediction capabilities of various machine learning models. The novelty of our study is that we used the Zivot-Andrews unit root test to determine the breakpoints and partitioned the time series into training and testing datasets along these points. We then examined which database partition gives the most accurate prediction. This information can be used to re-balance the portfolio. Two different AI-based prediction algorithms were used (GRU and LSTM), and a hybrid model (LSTM-GRU) was also included to investigate the predictability of inflation. Our results suggest that the average error of the inflation forecast is a quarter of that of the stock market index forecast. Inflation developments have a fundamental impact on equity and government bond returns. If we obtain a reliable estimate of the inflation forecast, we have time to rebalance the portfolio until the inflation shock is incorporated into government bond returns.

Combining the two methods provides better estimation accuracy than risk-adjusted valuation approaches, conventional neural networks, and linear benchmark models. The findings are persistent across in-sample and out-of-sample tests using 3926 venture capital and 1360 US IPO financing rounds between January 1989 and December 2008. More accurate estimates of the risk-return profile are due to less heterogeneous risk-free rates of return from the risk-neutral framework. Cascade neural networks nest both the linear and nonlinear functional estimation form in addition to taking account of variable interaction effects. Better estimation accuracy of the risk-return profile is desirable for investors so they can make a more informed judgement before committing capital at different stages of development and various financing rounds.;;;;;;;;;1;0;0;0;0;0;3;;;1351-847X;1466-4364;;;;;;;;;;Univ Nottingham, Sch Business, Nottingham NG8 1BB, England;;;;2014-02-19;WOS:000330103300002;;

The core idea of this study is to outline an automated framework for achieving a faster and easier parameter selection process, and at the same time, generating useful prediction uncertainty estimates in order to effectively tackle flexible real-world financial time series prediction problems. A Bayesian approach to SVR is discussed, and implemented. It is found that the direct implementation of the probabilistic framework of Gao et al. returns unsatisfactory results in our experiments. A novel enhancement is proposed by adding a new kernel scaling parameter mu to overcome the difficulties encountered. In addition, the multi-armed bandit Bayesian optimization technique is applied to automate the parameter selection process. Our framework is then tested on financial time series of various asset classes (i.e. equity index, credit default swaps spread, bond yields, and commodity futures) to ensure its flexibility. It is shown that the generalization performance of this parameter selection process can reach or sometimes surpass the computationally expensive cross-validation procedure. An adaptive calibration process is also described to allow practical use of the prediction uncertainty estimates to assess the quality of predictions. It is shown that the machine-learning approach discussed in this study can be developed as a very useful pricing tool, and potentially a market condition change detector. A further extension is possible by taking the prediction uncertainties into consideration when building a financial portfolio.;;;;;;;;;50;0;0;0;2;0;56;;;1469-7688;1469-7696;;;;;;;;;;UCL, Dept Comp Sci, Gower St, London WC1E 6BT, England;;;;2017-09-12;WOS:000407472100007;;

We investigate whether the predictive power of the economic and financial variables employed in the above studies can be enhanced if the statistical method of linear regression is replaced by feedforward neural networks with backpropagation of error. A shortcoming of backpropagation networks is that too many free parameters allow the neural network to fit the training data arbitrarily closely resulting in an overfitted network. Overfitted networks have poor generalization capabilities. We explore two methods that attempt to overcome this shortcoming by reducing the complexity of the network. The results of our experiments confirm that an overfitted network, while making better predictions for within-sample data, makes poor predictions for out-of-sample data. The methods for reducing the complexity of the network, explored in this paper, clearly help improve out-of-sample forecasts. We show that one cannot say that the linear regression forecasts are conditionally efficient with respect to the neural networks forecasts with any degree of confidence.

During the first stage, a neural-network-based generalization of the principal component analysis summarizes the information carried by the surface of log-mortality rates in a small number of latent factors. In the second step, these latent factors are forecast with an econometric model. The term structure of log-forces of mortality is next reconstructed by an inverse transformation. The neural analyzer is adjusted to French, UK and US mortality rates, over the period 1946-2000 and validated with data from 2001 to 2014.

When long-term rates decline, the effective duration of mortgage-backed securities (MBS) falls due to heightened refinancing expectations. I show that these changes in MBS duration function as large-scale shocks to the quantity of interest rate risk that must be borne by professional bond investors. I develop a simple model in which the risk tolerance of bond investors is limited in the short run, so these fluctuations in MBS duration generate significant variation in bond risk premia. Specifically, bond risk premia are high when aggregate MBS duration is high. The model offers an explanation for why long-term rates could appear to be excessively sensitive to movements in short rates and explains how changes in MBS duration act as a positive-feedback mechanism that amplifies interest rate volatility. I find strong support for these predictions in the time series of US government bond returns. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

This paper investigates whether the use of models which allow for negative interest rates can improve option pricing and implied volatility forecasting. This is done with special attention to foreign exchange and index options. To this end, we carried out an empirical analysis on the prices of call and put options on the US S&P 500 index and Eurodollar futures using a generalization of the Heston model in the stochastic interest rate framework. Specifically, the dynamics of the option's underlying asset is described by two factors: a stochastic variance and a stochastic interest rate. The volatility is not allowed to be negative, but the interest rate is. Explicit formulas for the transition probability density function and moments are derived. These formulas are used to estimate the model parameters efficiently. Three empirical analyses are illustrated.

Recognizing its sensitivity to macroeconomic conditions, the research integrates economic variables, including the federal funds rate, core Consumer Price Index (CPI), real Gross Domestic Product (GDP) growth rate, and the U.S. federal debt growth rate, to assess their influence on yield movements. Four forecasting models are employed for comparative analysis: linear regression (LR), decision tree (DT), random forest (RF), and multilayer perceptron (MLP) neural networks. Using historical data from the Federal Reserve Economic Data (FRED), this study finds that the RF model offers the most accurate short-term predictions, achieving the lowest mean squared error (MSE) and mean absolute error (MAE), with an R2 value of 0.5760. The results highlight the superiority of ensemble-based nonlinear models in capturing complex interactions between economic indicators and yield dynamics.

In this setting, alpha stands out as one of the most prevalent and refined measures of risk-adjusted return ever postulated, allowing for the estimation of the excess return that cannot be explained by the risk factors impacting an asset. This article introduces a neural network architecture designed to formulate an investment strategy with the explicit goal of maximizing alpha. The strategy, centered around market timing, determines on a daily basis, based on past returns of the risky asset, whether to fully invest in the risky asset or opt for the risk-free alternative. The neural network architecture comprises two components: a policy network for strategy implementation and an evaluation network for long-term alpha computation during parameter optimization. Employing value-weighted US size decile portfolios as risky assets, the study achieves significant out-of-sample alphas ranging from 3.6% to 8.2% per year under the $q<^>{5}$ asset pricing model (with a transaction cost assumption of one basis point). By construction, these alphas are not generated by risky asset growth. Robustness tests yield similar results with equal-weighted decile portfolios or under the Fama and French six-factor asset pricing model. Variations in transaction cost, number of past returns used as inputs, policy network design, or training sample size produce similar outcomes. This study underscores the effectiveness of reinforcement learning-inspired techniques in uncovering alpha in financial markets.;;;;;;;;;1;0;0;0;0;0;1;;;2169-3536;;;;;;;;;;;Univ Valle, Dept Accounting & Finance, Cali 760042, ColombiaUniv Valle, Dept Adm & Org, Cali 760042, Colombia;;;;2024-09-12;WOS:001306630100001;;

Subsequently, whether traditional economical models can ever outperform the random walk in forecasting out-of-sample exchange rates has received scholarly attention. Recently, a combination of fundamental models with machine learning methodologies was found to outcompete the predictability of random walk (Amat et al. 2018). This paper focuses on combining modern machine learning methodologies with traditional economic models and examines whether such combinations can outperform the prediction performance of random walk without drift. More specifically, this paper applies the random forest, support vector machine, and neural network models to four fundamental theories (uncovered interest rate parity, purchase power parity, the monetary model, and the Taylor rule models). We performed a thorough robustness check using six government bonds with different maturities and four price indexes, which demonstrated the superior performance of fundamental models combined with modern machine learning in predicting future exchange rates in comparison with the results of random walk. These results were examined using a root mean squared error (RMSE) and a Diebold-Mariano (DM) test. The main findings are as follows. First, when comparing the performance of fundamental models combined with machine learning with the performance of random walk, the RMSE results show that the fundamental models with machine learning outperform the random walk. In the DM test, the results are mixed as most of the results show significantly different predictive accuracies compared with the random walk. Second, when comparing the performance of fundamental models combined with machine learning, the models using the producer price index (PPI) consistently show good predictability. Meanwhile, the consumer price index (CPI) appears to be comparatively poor in predicting exchange rate, based on its poor results in the RMSE test and the DM test.;;;;;;;;;21;0;0;0;0;0;28;;;1911-8066;1911-8074;;;;;;;;;;Kobe Univ, Grad Sch Econ, Nada Ku, 2-1 Rokkodai, Kobe, Hyogo 6578501, Japan;;;;2020-04-15;WOS:000523491700021;;

The Treasury rates affect the investment decisions, portfolio management, capital structure, as well as corporate debt structure decisions of the firms. Even after this huge impact, the Treasury rate prediction problems are less explored. This paper investigates the efficacy of ensemble-based machine learning and deep learning models in predicting the behavior of Treasury bond yields. The work has employed six models on six Treasury index datasets with different maturity periods. The result suggests that the Recurrent Neural Network and its variants are best-suited models to work on Treasury bonds. The Gated Recurrent Unit gives the best result among all Recurrent Network variants. The deep learning models give higher accuracy for the Treasury yield with a greater maturity period. In contrast, the ensemble models perform better on the Treasury yield with a smaller maturity period.

These features of govs become particularly desirable in times of elevated risk which materialize in the form of the flight-to-safety (FTS) phenomenon. The FTS for govs provides a shelter during market turbulence and is exceptionally beneficial for portfolio drawdown risk reduction. However, what if the unsatisfactory expected return from treasuries discourages higher bonds allocations? This research proposes a solution to this problem with Deep Target Volatility Equity-Bond Allocation (DTVEBA) that dynamically allocate portfolios between equity and treasuries. The strategy is driven by a state-of-the-art recurrent neural network (RNN) that predicts next-day market volatility. An analysis conducted over a twelve year out-of-sample period found that with DTVEBA an investor may reduce treasury allocation by two (three) times to get the same Sharpe (Calmar) ratio and overper-forms the S & P500 index by 43% (115%).;;;;;;;;;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;;;2392-1641;2450-0097;;;;;;;;;;Poznan Univ Econ & Business, Inst Finance, Dept Investment & Financial Markets, Al Niepodleglosci 10, PL-61875 Poznan, Poland;;;;2023-08-10;WOS:001037180500009;;

Recently, several approaches using deep neural networks (DNNs) such as recurrent neural networks (RNNs) have been introduced for TS forecasting and have shown promising results. However, the applicability of these approaches is being questioned for TS settings where there is a lack of quality training data and where the TS to forecast exhibit complex behaviors. Examples of such settings include financial TS forecasting, where producing accurate and consistent long-term forecasts is notoriously difficult. In this work, we investigate whether DNN-based models can be used to forecast these TS conjointly by learning a joint representation of the series instead of computing the forecast from the raw time-series representations. To this end, we make use of the dynamic factor graph (DFG) to build a multivariate autoregressive model. We investigate a common limitation of RNNs that rely on the DFG framework and propose a novel variable-length attention-based mechanism (ACTM) to address it. With ACTM, it is possible to vary the autoregressive order of a TS model over time and model a larger set of probability distributions than with previous approaches. Using this mechanism, we propose a self-supervised DNN architecture for multivariate TS forecasting that learns and takes advantage of the relationships between them. We test our model on two datasets covering 19 years of investment fund activities. Our experimental results show that the proposed approach significantly outperforms typical DNN-based and statistical models at forecasting the 21-day price trajectory. We point out how improving forecasting accuracy and knowing which forecaster to use can improve the excess return of autonomous trading strategies. (C) 2020 Elsevier Inc.

Often, the support for the nonparametric methods is based on a benchmark such as the Black-Scholes (BS) model with constant volatility. In this paper, we study the stochastic volatility (SV) and stochastic volatility random jump (SVJ) models as parametric benchmarks against feedforward neural network (FNN) models, a class of neural network models. Our choice for FNN models is due to their well-studied universal approximation properties of an unknown function and its partial derivatives. Since the partial derivatives of an option pricing formula are risk pricing tools, an accurate estimation of the unknown option pricing function is essential for pricing and hedging. Our findings indicate that FNN models offer themselves as robust option pricing tools, over their sophisticated parametric counterparts in predictive settings. There are two routes to explain the superiority of FNN models over the parametric models in forecast settings. These are normormality of return distributions and adaptive learning.;;;;;;;;;28;1;0;0;0;0;31;;;1045-9227;1941-0093;;;;;;;;;;Simon Fraser Univ, Dept Econ, Burnaby, BC V5A 1S6, CanadaUniv Zurich, NCCR FINRISK, Swiss Banking Inst, CH-8032 Zurich, Switzerland;;;;2007-01-01;WOS:000243918400016;17278472;

This study investigates the performance of ML methods when predicting different measures of stock returns from various factor models and investigates the feature importance and interaction effects among firm-specific variables and macroeconomic factors in this context. Our findings reveal that neural network models exhibit consistent performance across different stock return measures when they rely solely on firm-specific characteristic variables. However, the inclusion of macroeconomic factors from the financial market, real economic activities, and investor sentiment leads to substantial improvements in the model performance. Notably, the degree of improvement varies with the specific measures of stock returns under consideration. Furthermore, our analysis indicates that, after the inclusion of macroeconomic factors, there is a dissimilarity in model performance, variable importance, and interaction effects among macroeconomic and firm-specific variables, particularly concerning abnormal returns derived from the Fama-French three- and five-factor models compared with excess returns.

These findings collectively offer valuable insights into the efficacy of neural network models for stock return predictions and contribute to a deeper understanding of the intricate relationship between factor models, stock returns, and macroeconomic conditions in the domain of empirical asset pricing.;;;;;;;;;6;0;0;0;0;0;7;;;;2199-4730;;;;;;;;;;Sapienza Univ Rome, Dept Econ & Law, Rome, Italy;;;;2024-06-06;WOS:001236211100001;;

Based on the sample of China's carbon emission trading pilot market, this paper firstly uses the Augmented Dickey-Fuller test and Autoregressive conditional heteroscedasticity model to test the stationarity and autocorrelation of carbon trading price returns, uses the Generalized Autoregressive Conditional Heteroscedasticity family model to analyze the persistence, risk and asymmetry of carbon trading price return fluctuations, and then proposes a hybrid prediction model neural network (generalized autoregressive conditional heteroscedasticity-long short-term memory network) due to the shortcomings of GARCH models in carbon price fluctuation analysis and prediction. The model is used to predict the carbon trading price. The results show that the carbon trading pilots have different degrees of volatility aggregation characteristics and the volatility persistence is long, among which only the Shanghai and Beijing carbon trading markets have risk premiums. The other pilot returns have no correlation with risks, and the fluctuations of carbon trading prices and returns are asymmetrical. The prediction results of different models show that the root mean square error (RMSE) of Hubei, Shenzhen and Shanghai carbon trading pilots based on the GARCH-LSTM model is significantly lower than that of the single GARCH model, and the RMSE values are reduced by 0.0006, 0.2993 and 0.0151, respectively. The RMSE in the three pilot markets improved by 0.0007, 0.3011 and 0.0157, respectively, compared to the standalone LSTM model. At the same time, compared with the single model, the GARCH-LSTM model significantly increased the R<^>2 value in Hubei (0.2000), Shenzhen (0.7607), Shanghai (0.0542) and Beijing (0.0595). Therefore, compared with other models, the GARCH-LSTM model can significantly improve the prediction accuracy of carbon price and provide a new idea for scientifically predicting the fluctuation of financial time series such as carbon price.;;;;;;;;;5;0;0;0;0;0;5;;;;2071-1050;;;;;;;;;;Xian Shiyou Univ, Sch Econ Management, Xian 710065, Peoples R ChinaRes Ctr Econ & Management Oil & Gas Resources, Xian 710065, Peoples R ChinaOcean Univ China, Sch Econ, Qingdao 266100, Peoples R China;Res Ctr Econ & Management Oil & Gas Resources;;;2024-03-08;WOS:001172222600001;;

We respond with development and testing of a framework using partisan and opportunistic political business cycle (PBC) theory to predict the investment risk perceived by investors holding sovereign bonds during 19 presidential elections in 12 developing countries from 1994 to 2000. Consistent with our framework, we find that bondholders perceive higher ( lower) investment risk in the form of higher (lower) credit spreads on their sovereign bonds as right-wing (left-wing) political incumbents appear more likely to be replaced by left-wing (right-wing) challengers. For international business research, our findings illustrate the promise of PBC theory in explaining the election-period behavior of sovereign bondholders and, perhaps, other investors who also 'vote' in developing country elections and can substantially influence the price and availability of capital there. For developing country investors and states, our findings highlight the financial effects of democracy in action, and underscore the importance of state communication with investors during election periods.;;;;;;;;;71;0;0;0;0;3;84;;;0047-2506;;;;;;;;;;;Tufts Univ, Fletcher Sch Law & Diplomacy, Medford, MA 02155 USASingapore Management Univ, Singapore, Singapore;;;;2005-01-01;WOS:000227116300007;;

They are less commonly applied to financial time series predictions, yet inherently suitable for this domain. We deploy LSTM networks for predicting out-of-sample directional movements for the constituent stocks of the S&P 500 from 1992 until 2015. With daily returns of 0.46 percent and a Sharpe ratio of 5.8 prior to transaction costs, we find LSTM networks to outperform memory-free classification methods, i.e., a random forest (RAF), a deep neural net (DNN), and a logistic regression classifier (LOG). The outperformance relative to the general market is very clear from 1992 to 2009, but as of 2010, excess returns seem to have been arbitraged away with LSTM profitability fluctuating around zero after transaction costs. We further unveil sources of profitability, thereby shedding light into the black box of artificial neural networks. Specifically, we find one common pattern among the stocks selected for trading - they exhibit high volatility and a short-term reversal return profile. Leveraging these findings, we are able to formalize a rules-based short-term reversal strategy that yields 0.23 percent prior to transaction costs. Further regression analysis unveils low exposure of the LSTM returns to common sources of systematic risk also compared to the three benchmark models. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

During the period, the central government always dominated the changing direction of the local government bond system. However, as fiscal decentralization reform has progressed, the institutional needs of local governments and investors have gradually gained attention. As a result, the size and variety of local government bonds are expanding. Through the introduction of analysis of system change based on situation structure performance (SSP), this paper uses Machine Learning (ML) approaches to predict the risk of government debt of China in the context of changing the local government bond system. Besides, this research work includes the comprehensive weight assignment for government debt hazard, fiscal revenue forecasting, default risk calculation, and finally an analysis of the validity of government debt hazard. The system may provide financial signal advice and strategy reference for dealing with hazards in early payment, organizing debt repayment significance order, optimizing fiscal revenue and cost structure, and so on.;;;;;;;;;3;0;0;0;0;0;3;;;1574-017X;1875-905X;;;;;;;;;;Ningbo Univ Finance & Econ, Ningbo, Zhejiang, Peoples R China;;;;2022-09-03;WOS:000843315700013;;

The new index is constructed by eliminating a common noise component in underlying sentiment proxies using the partial least squares (PLS) approach. The findings show that the new aligned sentiment index has much greater predictive power than the original principal component analysis (PCA)-based sentiment index both in- and out-of-sample. In addition, predictability is statistically significant, especially for bond premia with shorter maturities, even after controlling for a large number of financial and macro factors, as well as investor attention and manager sentiment indexes. Given the role of U.S. Treasury securities in forecasting of output and inflation, as well as in portfolio allocation decisions, our findings have significant implications for investors, policymakers, and researchers interested in accurately the forecasting return dynamics for these assets.

Therefore, in this paper, a novel trading strategy is proposed, grounded in multi-scale deep reinforcement learning and stock price trend prediction, with supervised learning and reinforcement learning unified within a unified framework. Our proposed method is separated into three stages. First, a novel network was designed to predict stock price movement (upward, stationary, or downward) with 67.34% accuracy by combining the strengths of Convolutional Neural Network and Long-Short Term Memory. Second, leveraging the trained trend prediction network, states were enhanced with daily and weekly stock information, and multi-scale and backbone network modules were employed for effective feature extraction. Finally, a Double Deep Q-Network algorithm based on the augmented state was adopted to learn robust trading strategies. This study also contributes to the theoretical advancement of stock price prediction models by introducing a hybrid CNN-LSTM architecture for trend prediction and a multi-scale feature extraction framework for improved decision-making. Experimental results across six U.S. financial assets demonstrate that a notable accuracy of 67.34% for price trend prediction is achieved by our Convolutional Neural Network-Long-Short Term Memory network. Furthermore, the proposed trading strategy outperforms other deep reinforcement learning algorithms, yielding an average annualized return of 44.47%. By comparison, the PPO model achieves 37.60%, the TDQN model achieves 13.38%, the DQN-vanilla model achieves 28.71%, and the DQN-pattern model achieves 22.21%.

The value of freight options, in practice, is estimated mostly by referring to forward curves. An option on freight has different properties from its financial counterparts, and the straightforward adoption of theoretical models does not produce promising results. In this paper, extension options, which have the property of options on futures, were transformed into regular European options before the application of the Black-Scholes model (BSM). The efficient market hypothesis, which justifies the parity of the performance of a long-term charter to that of repetitive short-term charters, worked as the basis for the transformation. The option values determined by the BSM were compared with actual realized values. Additionally, the artificial neural networks (ANN) was employed to derive the option values. This study is meaningful as the first-time application of both the closed-form solution and the ANN to the valuation of physical freight options. The research results can contribute to the quality of chartering decisions. The results could also be used in quantifying credit risk, as extension options tend to be granted to charterers with more creditability.;;;;;;;;;5;0;0;0;0;0;5;;;0308-8839;1464-5254;;;;;;;;;;Korea Maritime & Ocean Univ, Dept Shipping Management, Busan, South Korea;;;;2018-02-12;WOS:000424062200004;;

Then, it analyzes these research samples and imports the relevant data of 111 stocks into the DL NN model. The corresponding prediction results of stock prices are obtained. Finally, the stock portfolio model based on DL NN is compared with the data results of the Shanghai Stock Exchange (SSE) 50 Index and CSI 500 Index. The results show that the closing prices of the selected 111 stocks are relatively stable and fluctuate up and down around the horizontal axis, and the positive and negative returns are relatively balanced, roughly between -5% and 5%. There is a phenomenon of fluctuation aggregation to a certain extent. Comparing the prediction results of different models reveals that the prediction results of model c are closest to the actual stock price trend. Comparing the relevant returns of the proposed stock portfolio with other stocks uncovers that the annualized return of the stock portfolio based on the DL NN model is 47.44%. The sharp ratio is 1.52, the maximum pullback is 18.15%, the monthly excess return is 3.11%, and the information ratio is 0.82.

The study period covered the scenario of the World Health Organization pandemic declaration around March 2020 at hourly frequency. We have found that the different variants of deep neural network models outperform those of the GARCH family in the sense of the hetorerocedastic error, and absolute and squared error (HSE). Under the sharpe ratio, the volatility forecasting of a uniform portfolio at long horizons systematically outperforms the stablecoin Tether, which is considered here as the risk-free asset. Also, including transaction volume helps reduce the value at risk or loss probability for the uniform portfolio. Moreover, in a minimum variance portfolio, it is observed that before the pandemic declaration, a large proportion of the capital was allocated to bitcoin (BTC). In contrast, after March 2020, the portfolio is more diversified with short positions for BTC. Moreover, the MLP models give the best predictive results, although not statistically different in accuracy compared to the LSTM and LSTM-GARCH versions under the Diebold-Mariano test. In sum, MLP models outperform most stylised financial models and are less computationally expensive than more complex neural networks. Therefore, simple learning models are suggested in highly non-linear time series volatility forecasts as it is the cryptocurrency market.;;;;;;;;;36;0;0;0;0;0;43;;;0927-7099;1572-9974;;;;;;;;;;Ctr Invest Matemat, Unidad Monterrey, Alianza Ctr 502, Apodaca 66628, Nuevo Leon, MexicoConsejo Nacl Ciencia & Technol, Insurgentes Sur 1582, Mexico City 03940, Mexico;Ctr Invest Matemat;;;2023-03-30;WOS:000948847300001;37362593;

All models are assessed using statistical criteria such as correct directional change as well as financial criteria such as risk adjusted return. The main aim is to find which of these models generate the best returns and if nonlinear models can be used for generating excess returns in the precious metals market. This is achieved by implementing a trading simulation where the forecast is translated into a trading signal. Profit statistics are calculated taking into account transaction costs.It is concluded that, for the January 2000-May 2006 period under review, non-, linear models like MLPs and HONNs did outperform the linear ARMA models.

Forecasting recessions being very important though challenging, recessions in the selected countries are modeled recursively 1-10 quarters ahead out-of-sample using ANNs in conjunction with macroeconomic time series for all the countries. The out-of-sample forecast results show that in general no single macroeconomic variable employed appears to be useful for predicting recessions in any of the series. However, for Armenia, the treasury bill rate, industrial production, money supply, and the spread (the yield curve) are candidate variables for predicting recessions 1-10 quarters ahead. For Georgia, Kazakhstan, and Kyrgyzstan, the treasury bill rate and money supply series are candidate variables for predicting recessions 1-10 quarters ahead.;;;;;;;;;6;0;0;0;0;0;7;;;0927-7099;1572-9974;;;;;;;;;;Univ Nottingham, Ningbo, Zhejiang, Peoples R China;;;;2011-04-15;WOS:000288253700004;;

Traditional deep neural networks (DNN) often struggle with capturing long-term dependencies and multi-scale features in complex financial time series data. To address these challenges, we introduce CMR-DQN, an innovative framework that integrates discrete wavelet transform (DWT) for multi-scale data analysis, temporal convolutional network (TCN) for extracting deep temporal features, and a GRU-LSTM-Attention mechanism to enhance the model's focus and memory. Additionally, CMR-DQN employs the Rainbow DQN reinforcement learning strategy to learn optimal trading strategies in a simulated environment. CMR-DQN significantly improved the total return rate on six selected stocks, with increases ranging from 20.37% to 55.32%. It also demonstrated substantial improvements over the baseline model in terms of Sharpe ratio and maximum drawdown, indicating increased excess returns per unit of total risk and reduced investment risk. These results underscore the efficiency and effectiveness of CMR-DQN in handling multi-scale time series data and optimizing stock market decisions.;;;;;;;;;3;0;0;0;1;0;3;;;;2076-3417;;;;;;;;;;Hainan Univ, Sch Informat & Commun Engn, Haikou 570228, Peoples R ChinaCent South Univ, Sch Elect Infromat, Changsha 410083, Peoples R China;;;;2024-09-15;WOS:001305785700001;;

To address the challenges of capturing complex stochastic dynamics, this study proposes a novel Bayesian-Optimized GRU-Enhanced Physics-Informed Neural Network (G-PINNs) architecture, integrated with the Hull-White (HW) short-rate model, to improve the prediction accuracy of yield forecasting, zero-coupon bond (ZCB) pricing, and option pricing. The proposed framework effectively models time dependent variations and stochastic behavior in interest rate dynamics by leveraging Gated Recurrent Units (GRU) for sequential pattern recognition and Physics Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) to enforce financial constraints through partial differential equations (PDEs) of the HW model. For empirical validation, US treasury yield data from April 2020 to March 2025 is utilized. To achieve the best optimal hyperparameters to enhance both predictive accuracy and training efficiency, Bayesian Optimization (BO) is employed for hyperparameter tuning. The proposed model outperforms Vanilla PINNs as evidenced by higher R2 values and reduced error metrics (MAE, MSE, RMSE, Max & Min error, MSLE, Huber loss, MedAE) in yield prediction, ZCB pricing, and option pricing, as indicated by the numerical results. Furthermore, the results are statistically validated through the paired t-test, which confirms that the G-PINNs model's performance improvement is significant and not a consequence of random variation. Also, 5-fold cross-validation is performed to ensure robust and unbiased model evaluation across different data splits.;;;;;;;;;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;;;0955-7997;1873-197X;;;;;;;;;;Maulana Azad Natl Inst Technol, Dept Math Bioinformat & Comp Applicat, Bhopal, India;;;;2025-08-09;WOS:001540769400001;;

It is crucial for bonds and derivatives pricing, risk management, and reveals market expectations, which is essential for monetary policy decisions. This paper suggests the use of a differential evolutionary algorithm to estimate yield curves for US Treasury bonds. It considers parsimonious modeling to avoid non-convergence and high instability of traditional optimization algorithms when estimating model parameters caused by the choice of their initial values during curve fitting. In this approach, the whole yield curve for different maturities is obtained by models parameters estimates. Computational experiments show that the differential evolutionary algorithm provides more accurate yield curves than the ones derived by nonlinear least squares and genetic algorithm approaches.

Rarely is this more important than in the case of financial engineering, where the data generating processes are dominantly stochastic and only partially deterministic, Partly a tutorial, partly a review, this paper describes a collection of typical applications in options pricing, cointegration, the term structure of interest rates and models of investor behavior which highlight these weaknesses and propose and evaluate a number of solutions, We describe a number of alternative ways to deal with the problem of variable selection, show how to use model misspecification tests, we deploy a novel way based on cointegration to deal with the problem of nonstationarity, and generally describe approaches to predictive neural modeling which are more in tune with the requirements for modeling financial data series.;;;;;;;;;97;2;0;0;1;1;107;;;1045-9227;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;1997-11-01;WOS:A1997YE46600002;18255728;

It can also help financial institutions and investors better make investment decisions. In this sense, the forecast of inflation rate is of great significance. The existing literature mainly uses linear models such as autoregressive (AR) and vector autoregressive (VAR) models to predict the inflation rate. The nonlinear relationship between variables and the mining of historical data information are relatively lacking. Therefore, the prediction strategies and accuracy of the existing literature need to be improved. The predictive model designed in deep learning can fully mine the nonlinear relationship between variables and process complex long-term time series dynamic information, thereby making up for the deficiencies of existing research. Therefore, this paper employs the recurrent neural networks with gated recurrent unit (GRU-RNN) model to train and analyze the Consumer Price Index (CPI) indicators to obtain inflation-related prediction results. The experimental results on historical data show that the GRU-RNN model has good performance in predicting China's inflation rate. In comparison, the performance of the proposed method is significantly better than some traditional models, showing its superior effectiveness.;;;;;;;;;6;0;0;0;0;0;9;;;1687-5265;1687-5273;;;;;;;;;;Yunnan Univ, Sch Econ, Kunming 650000, Yunnan, Peoples R China;;;;2021-09-07;WOS:000691089500003;34456988;

These assets deteriorate due to aging, environmental conditions, and other external factors. Maintaining the performance of an asset in line with rational repair strategies represents a considerable challenge for decision-makers, who may not pay attention to developing adequate maintenance plans or leave the assets unmaintained. Worldwide, organizations are under pressure to ensure the sustainability of their assets. Such organizations may burden their treasury with random maintenance operations, especially with a limited budget. This research aims to develop a generalized condition assessment approach to monitor and evaluate existing facility elements. The proposed approach represents a methodology to determine the element condition index (CI). The methodology is reinforced with an artificial neural network (ANN) model to predict the element deterioration. The performance of this model was evaluated by comparing the obtained predicted CIs with ordinary least squares (OLS) regression model results to choose the most accurate prediction technique. A case study was applied to a group of wooden doors. The ANN model showed reliable results with R-2 values of 0.99, 0.98, and 0.99 for training, cross-validation, and testing sets, respectively. In contrast, the OLS model R-2 value was 1.00. These results show the high prediction capability of both models with an advantage to the OLS model. Applying this approach to different elements can help decision-makers develop a preventive maintenance schedule and provide the necessary funds.;;;;;;;;;6;0;0;0;0;0;7;;;;2075-5309;;;;;;;;;;Arab Acad Sci Technol & Maritime Transport AASTMT, Coll Engn & Technol, Construct & Bldg Engn Dept, Port Said 42511, EgyptArab Acad Sci Technol & Maritime Transport AASTMT, Coll Engn & Technol, Construct & Bldg Engn Dept, Cairo 11511, EgyptArab Acad Sci Technol & Maritime Transport AASTMT, Coll Engn & Technol, Construct & Bldg Engn Dept, Alexandria 21523, Egypt;Arab Acad Sci Technol & Maritime Transport AASTMT;;;2022-11-02;WOS:000872612200001;;

Our approach consists, first, of forecasting the CDS spread in order to estimate the forecasted CDS term structure. The general regression neural network (GRNN) is used to predict the CDS spread. By checking the accuracy of the prediction, the results show that the GRNN model can be recommended as an effective forecasting tool for CDS spread. Second, the predicted spreads are used to estimate the forecasted CDS term structure using the Nelson-Siegel model. The results show that for Russia, overall, the CDS spreads in the long term are less than those in the short term, which implies that the future outlook is more optimistic, given the events that occurred during the study period, but it still retains the highest level of credit risk compared to other countries. Unlike Brazil, India and South Africa, the future outlook is more pessimistic. For China, the term structure is unstable; in the short term, there is a tendency to reduce the risk, but for longer horizons, the risk will increase. Thus, BRICS countries have different risk profiles depending on investment horizons. The study's findings help policymakers in developing tailored risk management strategies for BRICS countries and guide investors in making informed credit investment decisions.

In this paper, we propose an enhanced recession prediction model that incorporates trends in the value of the yield spread. We expect our model to generate stronger recession signals because a steadily declining value of the yield spread typically indicates growing pessimism associated with the reduced future business activity. We capture trends in the yield spread by considering both the level of the yield spread at a lag of 12 months as well as its value at each of the previous two quarters leading up to the forecast origin, and we evaluate its predictive abilities using both logit and artificial neural network models. Our results indicate that models incorporating information from the time series of the yield spread correctly predict future recession periods much better than models only considering the spread value as of the forecast origin.

An empirical sample of 88 EU-based insurance groups was analyzed to provide robust evidence of the portfolio's impact on the Solvency Capital Requirement ratio from 2016 to 2022. Linear regression and supervised machine learning models, particularly extra trees regression, were used to predict the solvency ratios, with the latter outperforming the former. The investigation was supplemented with panel data analysis. Firm-specific factors, including, unit-linked and index-linked liabilities, firm size, investments in property, collective undertakings, bonds and equities, and the ratio of government bonds to corporate bonds and country-specific factors, such as life and non-life market concentration, domestic bond market development, private debt development, household spending, banking concentration, non-performing loans, and CO2 emissions, were found to have an important effect on insurers' solvency ratios. The novelty of this research lies in the investigation of the connection of solvency ratios with variables that prior studies have not yet explored, such as portfolio asset allocation, the life and non-life insurance market concentration, and unit-linked and index-linked products, via the employment of a battery of traditional and machine enhanced methods.

Compared with traditional investment, the advantage of quantitative investment lies in quantification and refinement. In quantitative investment technology, quantitative stock selection is the foundation. Without good stock selection ability, the effect of quantitative investment will be greatly reduced. Therefore, this paper builds an effective multi-factor stock selection model based on intelligent optimization algorithms and deep learning and proposes corresponding trading strategies based on this. First of all, this paper selects 26 effective factors of financial indicators, technical indicators and public opinion to construct the factor database. Secondly, a Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) neural network based on the Cuckoo Search (CS) optimization algorithm is used to build a stock selection model. Finally, a quantitative investment strategy is designed, and the proposed multi-factor deep learning stock selection model based on intelligent optimization is applied to practice to test its effectiveness. The results show that the quantitative trading strategy based on this model achieved a Sharpe ratio of 127.08%, an annualized rate of return of 40.66%, an excess return of 13.13% and a maximum drawdown rate of -17.38% during the back test period.

A large dataset consisting of 770 variables, encompassing macroeconomic, micro-firm, and cross-effect factors, was constructed to develop a machine learning-based dynamic capital asset pricing model. Additionally, we investigated the differences in factors influencing time-varying beta between state-owned enterprises (SOEs) and non-SOEs, providing economic explanations for the black-box issues. Our findings demonstrated the effectiveness of random forest and neural networks, with the four-layer neural network performing best and leading to a substantial rise in the excess return of the long-short portfolio, up to 0.36%. Notably, liquidity indicators emerged as the primary drivers influencing beta, followed by momentum. Moreover, our analysis revealed a shift in variable importance during the transition from SOEs to non-SOEs, as liquidity and momentum gradually replaced fundamentals and valuation as key determinants. This research contributes to both theoretical and practical domains by bridging the research gap in incorporating machine learning methods into asset pricing research.;;;;;;;;;5;0;0;0;0;0;5;;;;2227-7390;;;;;;;;;;Shanghai Univ Finance & Econ, Sch Finance, Shanghai 200433, Peoples R ChinaShanghai Jiao Tong Univ, Sch Elect Informat & Elect Engn, Shanghai 200240, Peoples R China;;;;2023-08-10;WOS:001036381400001;;

We apply a novel term structure model to decompose bond excess returns into expected excess returns (risk premia) and the innovation part. In order to explore these risk premia and innovations, we complement macro variables by financial condition variables as possible determinants of bond excess returns. We find that the expected part of bond excess returns is driven by macro factors, whereas innovations seem to be mainly influenced by financial conditions, before and after the financial crisis. Thus, financial conditions, such as financial stress, deserve attention when analyzing bond excess returns. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

The degree of multifractality in returns is measured to capture relevant nonlinear long-range autocorrelations. Risk premium forecasts are generated using economic indicators as predictors. Their economic value is assessed through a portfolio strategy that allocates between equities and risk-free assets based on these forecasts. The results show that higher levels of nonlinear long-range autocorrelations are associated with statistically significant out-of-sample risk premium forecasts. These periods also yield greater economic gains, underscoring the importance for investors of monitoring nonlinear dependencies when incorporating risk premium forecasts into portfolio decisions.;;;;;;;;;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;;;1350-4851;1466-4291;;;;;;;;;;Univ Sao Paulo, Sch Econ Business Accounting & Actuary, Dept Business Adm, Ave Prof Luciano Gualberto 908, BR-05508010 Sao Paulo, Brazil;;;;2025-05-02;WOS:001477412500001;;

More specifically, the purpose of our research is to disentangle the role of fundamental variables and market perception about variations on risk in order to explain the evolution of sovereign spreads in EMU during the recent crisis. Our results, in line with previous literature, show the importance of three groups of observable variables, namely, changes in risk-aversion of creditors, fiscal indebtedness and liquidity variables. In addition, our model includes unobserved components that are estimated through the Kalman filter as time-varying deviation from fixed-mean parameters of spread determinants. This shows the importance of expectations (market sentiments), amplifying (or reducing) the relative importance of the spread determinants over time through the time-varying behavior of the parameters around their steady-state estimates.

Consequently, it proposes a financial SIM model using deep Q network (DQN) as reinforcement earning (RL) algorithm and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) as deep neural network (DNN). Then, after training and optimization, the proposed model is back-tested. The research findings are as follows: the LSTM neural network (NN)-based model will import the observation of the market at each time and the change of transaction information over time. The LSTM network can find and learn the potential relationship between time series data. There are two hidden layers and one output layer in the model. The hidden layer is an LSTM structure and the output layer is the fully connected NN. DQN algorithm first stores the experience sample data of the agent-environment interaction into the experience pool. It then randomly selects a small batch of data from the experience pool to train the network. Doing so removes the correlation and dependence between samples so that the DNN model can better learn the value function in the RL task. The model can predict the future state according to historical information and decide which actions to take in the next step. Meanwhile, five stocks of Chinese A-shares are selected to form an asset pool. The initial 500,000 amount of the account is divided into five equal shares, which are invested and traded. Overall, the model account's rate of return (RoR) during the backtest is 32.12%. The Shanghai Stock Exchange (SSI) has risen by 19.157% in the same period. Thus, the model's performance has exceeded the SSI's in the same period. E stock has the maximum RoR of 78.984%. The RoR of A, B, and C stocks is 54.129%, 11.594%, and 9.815%, respectively. B stock presents a minimum RoR of 6.084%. All these stocks have got positive returns. Therefore, the proposed financial SIM based on the DL algorithm is scientific and feasible. The research content has certain significant reference for the DL-based financial SIM.;;;;;;;;;3;0;0;0;0;0;3;;;1687-5265;1687-5273;;;;;;;;;;Univ Toronto, Fac Informat, Toronto, ON, CanadaGuangzhou Univ, Comp Sci & Technol, Guangzhou 510006, Peoples R China;;;;2022-11-04;WOS:000872079200005;35880062;

This paper introduces an approach which generates a nonlinear strategy that explicitly maximizes the Sharpe Ratio. It is expressed as a neural network model whose output is the position size between a risky and a risk-free asset. The iterative parameter update rules are derived and compared to alternative approaches. The resulting trading strategy is evaluated and analyzed on both computer-generated data and real world data (DAX, the daily German equity index). Trading based on Sharpe Ratio maximization compares favorably to both profit optimization and probability matching (through cross-entropy optimization). The results show that the goal of optimizing out-of-sample risk-adjusted profit can indeed be achieved with this nonlinear approach.;;;;;;;;;12;0;0;0;0;0;15;;;0129-0657;;;;;;;;;;;Siemens Nixdorf Informat Syst Inc, Adv Technol Grp, Burlington, MA 01803 USANYU, Leonard N Stern Sch Business, Dept Informat Syst, New York, NY 10012 USA;;;;1997-08-01;WOS:000075714900005;9730018;

This study develops a hybrid TFR prediction model based on an artificial neural network (ANN) and an adaptive genetic algorithm (AGA). The AGA adaptively searches satisficing network parameters such as input delay size. The ANN iteratively optimizes a prediction network considering parsimonious variables and time-lag effects as predictors. Three parsimonious variables (crude oil price, fleet productivity and bunker price) are selected by a stepwise regression of TFR variables. The article compares the performance of its hybrid model with two traditional approaches (regression and moving average), as well as with the findings of existing ANN studies. The results of our model (root mean squared error (RMSE)= 11.2 WS) are not only significantly superior to the regression approach (RMSE = 21.6 WS) and the moving average approach (RMSE = 17.5 WS), but are even slightly superior to the results of existing ANN studies (RMSE = 14.6 WS-15.8 WS).;;;;;;;;;24;2;0;0;0;0;34;;;1479-2931;1479-294X;;;;;;;;;;Univ Ulsan, Sch Ind Engn, 93 Daehak Ro, Ulsan 44610, South Korea;;;;2017-08-01;WOS:000410866000007;;

The target volatility level is achieved by dynamically allocating between a risky asset and a risk-free cash position. However, a challenge to data-driven approaches is the limited availability of data since periods of high volatility, such as during financial crises, are relatively rare. To resolve this issue, we apply a stability-oriented approach to compare data for the current period to a past set of data for a period of low volatility, providing a much more abundant source of data for comparison. In order to explore the impact of the proposed model, the results of this approach will be compared to different volatility forecast methodologies, such as the volatility index, the historical volatility, the exponentially weighted moving average (EWMA), and the generalized autoregressive conditional heteroskedasticity (GARCH) model. Trading measures are used to evaluate the performance of the models for forecasting volatility. An empirical study of the proposed model is conducted using the Korea Composite Stock Price Index 200 (KOSPI 200) and certificate of deposit interest rates from January, 2006 to February, 2016.

In contrast to the traditional linear regression scheme that is usually used to describe the relationship between the stock forward return and company characteristics, the field of finance has experienced the rapid development of tree-based algorithms and neural network paradigms when illustrating complex stock dynamics. These nonlinear methods have proved to be effective in predicting stock prices and selecting stocks that can outperform the general market. This article implements and evaluates the robustness of the random forest (RF) model in the context of the stock selection strategy. The model is trained for stocks in the Chinese stock market, and two types of feature spaces, fundamental/technical feature space and pure momentum feature space, are adopted to forecast the price trend in the long run and the short run, respectively. It is evidenced that both feature paradigms have led to remarkable excess returns during the past five out-of-sample period years, with the Sharpe ratios calculated to be 2.75 and 5 for the portfolio net value of the multi-factor space strategy and momentum space strategy, respectively. Although the excess return has weakened in recent years with respect to the multi-factor strategy, our findings point to a less efficient market that is far from equilibrium.;;;;;;;;;38;0;0;0;2;0;50;;;;2405-8440;;;;;;;;;;Xiyuan Hedge Fund, 388 Yizhou Rd, Chengdu, Sichuan, Peoples R ChinaSouthwestern Univ Finance & Econ, Inst Chinese Financial Studies, 555 Liutai Ave, Chengdu, Sichuan, Peoples R China;Xiyuan Hedge Fund;;;2019-09-30;WOS:000484391200174;31463404;

Lagged values of these features up to 10 previous days are also used. Four machine learning models are used: Random Forest, Gradient Boosted Regression Trees (GBRT), and Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), to forecast future gold prices. The study finds that the most influential stocks indices for prediction are one-day lagged data of ASX, S&P500, TA35, IBEX, and AEX, as well as U.S. and Japan bonds yields and delayed data of gas and silver. Furthermore, the study's models identify that one-day lagged VIX score and our VIX dummy variable have a significant impact on gold price, indicating that economic uncertainty affects gold prices.

Prior research has established the effectiveness of machine learning in forecasting stock market trends, irrespective of the analytical approach employed, be it technical, fundamental, or sentiment analysis. In the context of fiscal year-end selection, the decision may initially seem straightforward, with December 31 being the apparent choice, as discussed by B. Kamp in 2002. The primary argument for a uniform fiscal year-end centers around comparability. When assessing the financial performance of two firms with differing fiscal year-ends, substantial shifts in the business environment during non-overlapping periods can impede meaningful comparisons. Moreover, when two firms merge, the need to synchronize their annual reporting often results in shorter or longer fiscal years, complicating time series analysis. In the US S&P stock market, misaligned fiscal years lead to variations in report publication dates across different industries and market segments. Since the financial reporting dates of US S&P companies are determined independently by each listed entity, relying solely on these dates for investment decisions may prove less than entirely reliable and impact the accuracy of return prediction models. Hence, our interest lies in the synchronized fiscal year of the TW stock market, leveraging machine learning models for fundamental analysis to forecast returns. We employed four machine learning models: Random Forest (RF), Feedforward Neural Network (FNN), Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU), and Financial Graph Attention Network (FinGAT). We crafted portfolios by selecting stocks with higher predicted returns using these machine learning models. These portfolios outperformed the TW50 index benchmarks in the Taiwan stock market, demonstrating superior returns and portfolio scores. Our study's findings underscore the advantages of using aligned financial ratios for predicting the top 20 high-return stocks in a mid-to-long-term investment context, delivering over 50% excess returns across the four models while maintaining lower risk profiles. Using the top 10 high-return stocks produced over 100% relative returns with an acceptable level of risk, highlighting the effectiveness of employing machine learning techniques based on financial ratios for stock prediction.;;;;;;;;;7;0;0;0;0;0;7;;;;2227-7390;;;;;;;;;;Natl Yang Ming Chiao Tung Univ, Comp Sci Dept, 1001 Daxue Rd, Hsinchu 300093, Taiwan;;;;2024-02-10;WOS:001116152700001;;

We find that macroeconomic and financial variables contain valuable information in explaining local currency bond excess returns. Additionally, we extend our analysis to investigate how the influence of different factors change depending on the level of global risk appetite. Although macro fundamentals have an important role in explaining the risk premiums during tranquil times, investors pay less attention to changes in inflation forecast in times of high risk aversion. Positive credit rating changes decrease the bond risk premium in both regimes with a different magnitude. Also, the influence of exchange rate volatility is more pronounced during the time of market stress.;;;;;;;;;9;0;0;0;0;0;9;;;1566-0141;1873-6173;;;;;;;;;;Cent Bank Republ Turkey, Ankara, Turkey;;;;2019-04-15;WOS:000463302500010;;

In the original setup, a news article is assumed to address policy uncertainty if it contains certain predefined keywords. We argue that the original setup is prone to measurement error, and propose an alternative methodology using text mining techniques. We compare the original method to modality annotation and support vector machines (SVM) classification in order to create an EPU index for Belgium. Validation on an out-of-sample test set speaks in favour of using an SVM classification model for constructing a news-based policy uncertainty indicator. The indicators are then used to forecast 10 macroeconomic and financial variables. The original method of measuring EPU does not have predictive power for any of these 10 variables. The SVM indicator has a higher predictive power and, notably, changes in the level of policy uncertainty during tumultuous periods of high uncertainty and risk can predict changes in the sovereign bond yield and spread, the credit default swap spread, and consumer confidence.

The risk premia remunerate investors for unexpected changes in the default intensity. A number of interesting results emerge from the analysis. First, the risk premia contribution to spreads decreases over the sample, 2003-07, and rebounds at the start of the 'credit crunch.' Second, daily risk premia co-move with US macro variables and corporate default risk. Third, global factors explain most of Latin American countries' premia, and local factors best explain European and Asian premia. The importance of global factors grows over time. Finally, conditioning on lagged local and global variables at a weekly frequency, sovereign risk premia are highly predictable. (c) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

We study the ratio between the risk-neutral and actual default intensities, which we call the coverage ratio or the relative credit risk premium. Actual default intensities are derived from rating agencies annual transition matrices, while risk-neutral default intensities are bootstrapped from CDS quotes of European corporates. We quantify the average risk premium and its changes over time. Compared to related literature, special attention is given to the effects of the recent financial and European sovereign crises. We find that average credit risk premia rose substantially and that post-crisis levels are still higher than those observed before the financial crisis. This observation is especially true for high-quality debt and if it persists, it will have an impact on corporates funding costs. The quantification and revision of risk premia contributes to the discussion of the credit spread puzzle and could give extra insights in valuation models that start from real-world estimates.

Given these implications, we employ a nonparametric estimation technique to document the empirical relation between the risk premium and the slope of the term. structure using almost two hundred years of data. Of particular interest, the risk premium is increasing in the term structure slope; however, for either small or negative slopes, the risk premium is much more sensitive to changes in interest rates. In addition, the empirical results imply negative expected equity risk premiums for some inverted term structures. Finally, variations in the risk premium do not appear to be related to variations in the variance of equity returns. We illustrate these features in a stylized consumption-based model, and provide the economic intuition behind the results.";;;;;;;;;27;0;0;0;0;0;32;;;0025-1909;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;1997-03-01;WOS:A1997WQ99900008;;

I found that a shock to variance risk premium causes long-lasting increases in the market variance pointing to the limitedness of investors information-processing capacity. At the same time, the shock generates consecutive increases in realized correlations between individual stocks and the market portfolio.

Unlike the existing measures, ours are able to detect and quantify nonlinear causal effects. The new measures are based on nonparametric regressions and defined as logarithmic functions of restricted and unrestricted mean square forecast errors. They are easily and consistently estimated by replacing the unknown mean square forecast errors by their nonparametric kernel estimates. We derive the asymptotic normality of nonparametric estimator of causality measures, which we use to build tests for their statistical significance. We establish the validity of smoothed local bootstrap that one can use in finite sample settings to perform statistical tests. Monte Carlo simulations reveal that the proposed test has good finite sample size and power properties for a variety of data-generating processes and different sample sizes. Finally, the empirical importance of measuring nonlinear causality in mean is also illustrated. We quantify the degree of nonlinear predictability of equity risk premium using variance risk premium. Our empirical results show that the variance risk premium is a very good predictor of risk premium at horizons less than 6 months. We also find that there is a high degree of predictability at the 1-month horizon, that can be attributed to a nonlinear causal effect.

Our paper fills this gap by comparing the predictive ability of technical indicators with that of macroeconomic variables. Technical indicators display statistically and economically significant in-sample and out-of-sample predictive power, matching or exceeding that of macroeconomic variables. Furthermore, technical indicators and macroeconomic variables provide complementary information over the business cycle: technical indicators better detect the typical decline in the equity risk premium near business-cycle peaks, whereas macroeconomic variables more readily pick up the typical rise in the equity risk premium near cyclical troughs. Consistent with this behavior, we show that combining information from both technical indicators and macroeconomic variables significantly improves equity risk premium forecasts versus using either type of information alone. Overall, the substantial countercyclical fluctuations in the equity risk premium appear well captured by the combined information in technical indicators and macroeconomic variables.;;;;;;;;;651;19;0;0;4;0;808;;;0025-1909;1526-5501;;;;;;;;;;Fed Reserve Bank St Louis, Div Res, St Louis, MO 63166 USASt Louis Univ, John Cook Sch Business, Dept Econ, St Louis, MO 63108 USASingapore Management Univ, Lee Kong Chian Sch Business, Dept Finance, Singapore 178899, SingaporeWashington Univ, Olin Business Sch, St Louis, MO 63130 USA;;;;2014-07-01;WOS:000338719600009;;

This may be partly due to limited data availability. However, emerging bond markets are becoming increasingly important and liquid. It is, therefore, important to be understand whether conclusions drawn from developed countries carry over to emerging markets. We estimate model parameters of fully flexible Nelson-Siegel-Svensson term structures model which has become one of the most popular term structure model among academics, practitioners, and central bankers. We investigate four sets of bond data: U.S. Treasuries, and three major emerging market government bond data-sets (Brazil, Mexico and Turkey). By including both the very dense U.S. data and the comparatively sparse emerging market data, we ensure that are results are not specific to a particular data-set. We find that gradient and direct search methods perform poorly in estimating term structures of interest rates, while global optimization methods, particularly the hybrid particle swarm optimization introduced in this paper, do well. Our results are consistent across four countries, both in- and out-of-sample, and for perturbations in prices and starting values. For academics and practitioners interested in optimization methods, this study provides clear evidence of the practical importance of choice of optimization method and validates a method that works well for the NSS model.;;;;;55th Meeting of EURO-Working-Group on Commodities and Financial Modelling (EWGCFM)55th Meeting of EURO-Working-Group on Commodities and Financial Modelling (EWGCFM);MAY 14-16, 2015MAY 14-16, 2015;"EURO Working Grp Commodities & Financial Modelling; Middle E Tech Univ, Inst Appl Math; Assoc European Operat Res SocEURO Working Grp Commodities & Financial Modelling; Middle E Tech Univ, Inst Appl Math; Assoc European Operat Res Soc";METU, Ankara, TURKEYMETU, Ankara, TURKEY;6;0;0;0;0;0;6;;;0254-5330;1572-9338;;;;;;;;;;Ozyegin Univ, Istanbul Risk Management Lab, Istanbul, TurkeyBogazici Univ, Ctr Appl Res Finance, Istanbul, Turkey;;;;2018-01-01;WOS:000419148700003;;

In this paper we do so. We use neither the no-arbitrage approach nor the equilibrium approach. Instead, we use variations on the Nelson-Siegel exponential components framework to model the entire yield curve, period-by-period, as a three-dimensional parameter evolving dynamically. We show that the three time-varying parameters may be interpreted as factors corresponding to level, slope and curvature, and that they may be estimated with high efficiency. We propose and estimate autoregressive models for the factors, and we show that our models are consistent with a variety of stylized facts regarding the yield Curve. We use our models to produce term-structure forecasts at both short and long horizons, with encouraging results. In particular, our forecasts appear much more accurate at long horizons than various standard benchmark forecasts.

Traditional models assume a linear relationship between risk exposure and expected returns, leading to biases. By incorporating level, slope, and curvature factors derived from Treasury index returns, the proposed model better captures the nonlinear nature of bond returns. Empirical tests on passive and active US government bond portfolios confirm its accuracy in estimating passive style returns and active alpha. The study also provides the first performance analysis of fixed-income separate accounts, revealing their economic significance and superior value-added performance over mutual funds.;;;;;;;;;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;;;1058-3300;1873-5924;;;;;;;;;;Univ Augsburg, Fac Econ & Business Adm, Univ Str 16, D-86135 Augsburg, GermanyUniv Utrecht, Sch Econ, Utrecht, Netherlands;;;;2025-09-06;WOS:001561493900001;;

The proposed method employs a hybrid approach, integrating a 1-dimensional convolutional neural network (1DCNN), long-short term memory (LSTM), and XGBoost algorithms. The 1DCNN is used to learn local and short-term patterns, while LSTM is employed to capture both short and long-term dependencies. Furthermore, we have implemented an algorithm that utilizes hull moving average (HMA) and simple moving average (SMA) crossover data to detect trading entry points and major trends in the market. The combination of the SMA-HMA crossover algorithm and predictions provided by the 1DCNN-BiLSTM-XGBoost algorithm yields exceptional results in terms of prediction accuracy and profitability. Additionally, these integrated techniques effectively filter out noise and mitigate false breakouts, which are often observed with US 30-year Treasury bonds. In the field of financial time series prediction, the effectiveness of 1DCNN and LSTM in identifying trading entry points and market perturbations has not been comprehensively studied. Therefore, our work fills this gap by demonstrating through experiments that the proposed 1DCNN-BiLSTM-XGBoost algorithm, in combination with moving average crossovers, effectively reduces noise and market perturbations. This leads to the precise identification of trading entry points and accurate recognition of trend signals for US 30-year Treasury bonds. We demonstrate through experiments that our proposed approach achieves an average root mean squared error of 0.0001 and an R-square value of 0.9999, highlighting its promise as a method for predicting market trends and trading entry points for US 30-year Treasury bonds.;;;;;;;;;2;0;0;0;0;0;2;;;0266-4720;1468-0394;;;;;;;;;;Abdelmalek Essaadi Univ, Lab R&D Engn Sci, FST Al Hoceima, Tetouan, MoroccoUniv Burgundy, IMVIA Lab, Dijon, FranceAbdelmalek Essaadi Univ, Lab R&D Inengn Sci, FST Al Hoceima, Tetouan 93000, Morocco;;;;2023-10-12;WOS:001071791200001;;

The importance of this particular nonlinearity is two-fold. First, it allows to identify the NFA level above which the elasticity becomes much (possibly dangerously) higher. Second, such a nonlinear relationship is a standard ingredient of dynamic stochastic general equilibrium (DSGE) models, but its proper calibration/estimation is missing. Our estimation shows that indeed the link is highly nonlinear and helps to identify the NFA position where the nonlinearity kicks in at approximately -70% to -75% of GDP. We also provide a proper calibration of the risk premium-NFA relationship which can be used in DSGE models and demonstrate that its slope matters significantly for economic dynamics in such a model.;;;;;;;;;6;0;0;0;1;0;6;;;1365-1005;1469-8056;;;;;;;;;;Narodowy Bank Polski, Warsaw, PolandSGH Warsaw Sch Econ, Warsaw, Poland;;;;2020-05-27;WOS:000531536300004;;

Among the machine learning approaches, GMDH demonstrates the best performance in forecasting the CDS term structure. According to the subperiod analysis, the performance of all models was inconsistent with the data period. All the models were less predictable in highly volatile data periods than in less volatile periods. This study will enable traders and policymakers to invest efficiently and make policy decisions based on the current and future risk factors of a company or country.;;;;;;;;;15;0;0;0;1;0;18;;;1076-2787;1099-0526;;;;;;;;;;POSTECH, Dept Ind & Management Engn, Gyeongbuk 37673, South KoreaGachon Univ, Dept Financial Math, Gyeonggi 13120, South Korea;;;;2020-08-19;WOS:000556266800003;;

The backtesting results indicate that incorporating the relative variance risk premium into the GARCH model, greatly enhances the forecasts of one-day-ahead Value-at-Risk (VaR) for a long trading position in developed markets, while the standard GARCH is the most relevant specification in capturing risk in emerging markets. Results are found to be robust against distressed financial markets and alternative measures of the variance risk premium. Moreover, the empirical evidence shows that the superior performance of these models cannot completely reduce the scope of implied volatility as a risk management tool. Including implied volatility into the GARCH model incurs substantial savings in terms of efficient regulatory capital provisions. (C) 2019 Board of Trustees of the University of Illinois.

The measures are based on nonparametric quantile regressions and defined as logarithmic functions of restricted and unrestricted expectations of quantile check loss functions. They can consistently be estimated by replacing the unknown expectations of check loss functions by their nonparametric kernel estimates. We derive a Bahadur-type representation for the nonparametric estimator of the measures. We establish the asymptotic distribution of this estimator, which can be used to build tests for the statistical significance of the measures. Thereafter, we show the validity of a smoothed local bootstrap that can be used in finite-sample settings to perform statistical tests. A Monte Carlo simulation study reveals that the bootstrap-based test has a good finite-sample size and power properties for a variety of data-generating processes and different sample sizes. Finally, we provide an empirical application to illustrate the usefulness of measuring Granger causality in quantiles. We quantify the degree of predictability of the quantiles of equity risk premium using the variance risk premium, unemployment rate, inflation, and the effective federal funds rate. The empirical results show that the variance risk premium and effective federal funds rate have a strong predictive power for predicting the risk premium when compared to that of the predictive power of the other two macro variables. In particular, the variance risk premium is able to predict the center, lower, and upper quantiles of the distribution of the risk premium; however, the effective federal funds rate predicts only the lower and upper quantiles. Nevertheless, unemployment and inflation rates have no effect on the risk premium.";;;;;;;;;19;0;0;0;0;0;22;;;0735-0015;1537-2707;;;;;;;;;;Peking Univ, Guanghua Sch Management, Dept Business Stat & Econometr, Beijing, Peoples R ChinaPeking Univ, Guanghua Sch Management, Ctr Stat Sci, Beijing, Peoples R ChinaUniv Durham, Sch Business, Dept Econ & Finance, Mill Hill Lane, Durham DH1 3LB, England;;;;2020-04-30;WOS:000527188300001;;

We developed a macromarketing framework to provide a linkage between the consumers, producers, and societal impacts of GE corn. An empirical Arbitrage Pricing Model (APT) was used to quantify risks and risk premiums associated with GE corn production. The risk premium deduced from the APT model provides a measure of intrinsic compensation for taking on higher or lower risks by participants in the marketing system. An Auto -Regressive Distributed Lag (ARDL) regression estimation of the APT model reveals that GE causes corn prices to go down due to increase supply, but significantly reduced the risk premium for producing corn in the United States.

The subjects of the analyses were three economically viable seams at one of the bituminous coal deposits in Poland. The source of information was the geological model and operational data of the mine X. The simulation was developed based on non-parametric bootstrapping, where the influence of coal quality parameters, seam thickness, spatial density of coal, and waste rock derived from coal partings, floor cutting and dinting, and roof falls, was tested.The interdependencies of geological and mining parameters were replicated in a simulation model using Gaussian and empirical copulas. In the model, the relationship between the amount of total waste rock and operating costs was associated with the use of elaborate mathematical formulas. Economic appraisal was based on an income approach, using the free cash flow for the firm (FCFF) analysis and discounting process.Based on the Gaussian copula, in the X-1 and X-2 seams, the average NPV differences achieved were a maximum of 39%. In the case of IRR, the mean difference did not exceed 3.6% points (pp). The quantified spread between the correlated and uncorrelated average values of NPV was at most 45% and 4.8 pp for IRR. Empirical copula limits the range of variation of input and output parameters, resulting in different values for the average NPV, at a maximum of 11.8%, and IRR, 2.4 pp.If the IRR reflects the level of expected return of investment, it can be stated that the additional risk premium resulting from the volatility and correlation of analysed deposits parameters of bituminous coal should be relatively low and less than 2.4 pp in similar cases. The analyses also revealed that the amount of available geological information is of secondary importance in the valuation process, as it does not negatively affect the regularity and symmetry of predicted outcomes.;;;;;;;;;9;0;0;0;0;0;12;;;0301-4207;1873-7641;;;;;;;;;;Polish Acad Sci, Mineral & Energy Econ Res Inst, Krakow, Poland;;;;2018-04-13;WOS:000428607100019;;

One variable that has not received enough attention is interest rate volatility, despite its importance for decision-makers in both financial markets and the real economy. The study uses a panel data set of a maximum of 93 countries over the years 1998-2017. We use panel data estimators (panel fixed effects and fixed effects filter). Our main findings are that CBT helps to reduce the volatility of several interest rates (money market rates, deposit rates, savings rates, Treasury bill yields and government bond yields), while it increases the volatility of monetary policy rates. The results are also significant from an economic point of view, as a small increase in CBT can reduce the variability of treasury bill rates by up to -8.2%, deposit rates by up to -9.1%, money market rates by up to -15.8% and savings rates by up to -20.4%.;;;;;;;;;1;0;0;0;0;0;1;;;1076-9307;1099-1158;;;;;;;;;;ESSCA Sch Management, Acad Dept Econ Law & Soc, Lyon, France;;;;2024-12-28;WOS:001381993900001;;

The conditioning information used for the nonparametric analysis is that implied by the theoretical model of time-varying risk. Thus, the kernel estimator is used, in conjunction with a nonparametric diagnostic test for in-sample residual nonlinear structure, to assess the adequacy of the parametric model in capturing any structure in the excess returns.Our results support the parametric specification of an asset pricing model in which the conditional beta is the ratio of the relevant components of the conditional covariance matrix of returns modelled as a bivariate generalized ARCH process. Although the predictable component of the conditional moments is relatively small, the parametric estimator of the risk premia has somewhat more out-of-sample forecasting ability than does the kernel estimator.

We calibrate one, two and three factor linear Gaussian models using the Kalman filter oil two different bond yield data sets and compare their out-of-sample forecasting performance. One-step ahead as well as four-step ahead out-of-sample forecasts are analyzed based on the weekly data. When evaluating the one-step ahead forecasts, it is shown that a one factor model may be adequate when only the short-dated or only the long-dated yields are considered, but two and three factor models performs significantly better when the entire yield spectrum is considered. Furthermore, the results demonstrate that the predictive ability of multi-factor models remains intact far ahead out-of-sample, with accurate predictions available up to one year after the last calibration for one data set and up to three months after the last calibration for the second, more volatile data set. The experimental data denotes two different periods with different yield volatilities, and the stability of model parameters after calibration ill both the cases is deemed to be both significant and practically useful. When it comes to four-step ahead predictions, the quality of forecasts deteriorates for all models, as can be expected, but the advantage of using a multi-factor model as compared to a one factor model is still significant.In addition to the empirical study above, we also suggest a non-linear filter based on linear programming for improving the term structure matching at a given point in time. This method, when used in place of a Kalman filter update, improves the term structure fit significantly with a minimal added computational overhead. The improvement achieved with the proposed method is illustrated for out-of-sample data for both the data sets. This method call be used to model a parameterized yield curve consistently with the underlying short rate dynamics. (c) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

Efficiency is measured by the return's degree of multifractality, calculated from the multifractal detrended fluctuation analysis method. For the S&P 500 index during the 1951-2022 period, the results show that market efficiency varies over time, with recurrent periods of statistically significant inefficiency (multifractality). Moments of inefficiency are associated with (i) a higher level of financial uncertainty-financial uncertainty Granger causes the degree of multifractality (inefficiency), (ii) a greater variability in the patterns of dependence of returns and also (iii) with periods of more relevant volatility clusters. In times of market inefficiency (efficiency), the use of financial (technical) indicators shows statistically significant in-sample and out-of-sample accuracy for equity risk premium prediction. When the market is efficient (inefficient), the use of financial (technical) indicators should be avoided due to the degradation of their predictive capacity. To build accurate and statistically significant predictions of the risk premium, thus enhancing decision-making processes, investors should monitor the informational efficiency status of the market before selecting financial and technical indicators as predictive variables. Finally, during market inefficiency periods, there is a greater polarisation of investors' opinions, with increased attention to fundamental variables for risk premium prediction, leading to a breakdown in price trend patterns, explaining the worst predictive capacity of technical indicators.;;;;;;;;;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;;;1076-9307;1099-1158;;;;;;;;;;Univ Sao Paulo, Sch Econ Business Accounting & Actuary, Dept Business Adm, Sao Paulo, Brazil;;;;2024-11-01;WOS:001339768300001;;

This article presents a new econometric framework for estimation of affine Gaussian DTSMs under restrictions on risk prices, which addresses the issues of a large model space and of model uncertainty using a Bayesian approach. A simulation study demonstrates the good performance of the proposed method. Data for U.S.Treasury yields calls for tight restrictions on risk pricing: only level risk is priced, and only changes in the slope affect term premia. Incorporating the restrictions changes the model-implied short-rate expectations and term premia. Interest rate persistence is higher than in a maximally flexible model, hence expectations of future short rates are more variablerestrictions on risk prices help resolve the puzzle of implausibly stable short-rate expectations in this literature. Consistent with survey evidence and conventional macro wisdom, restricted models attribute a large share of the secular decline in long-term interest rates to expectations of future nominal short rates.

This study identifies macroeconomic factors for forecasting excess returns in emerging government bond markets under spanning hypothesis. We find that in previous research, government intervention factors employed in excess returns forecasting have no additional predictive ability, as they are already incorporated in current yields.

Currently, empirical literature on term structure models is relatively scarce for CESEE economies due to the degree of financial market development and, consequently, the limited market data availability. Therefore, our approach contributes to this line of research by estimating the model using term structure data starting from 2011 and comparing the results with public information on term premia published by the Federal Reserve. We find that the term premium estimated for Romania generally follows international dynamics, signaling a high degree of sensitivity to external events, with several episodes of diverging behavior largely explained by internal factors. Finally, we analyzed the ways in which the term premium can been used for macro-financial purposes. In this regard, we investigated the manner in which the information set carried by the evolution of term premium can been exploited for predictability of the industrial production, CPI and private credit, as proxies for the business cycles, monetary policy stance and financial cycle/macroprudential stance.;;;;;;;;;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;;;0424-267X;1842-3264;;;;;;;;;;Romanian Amer Univ, Bucharest, RomaniaBucharest Univ Econ Studies, Bucharest, Romania;Romanian Amer Univ;;;2018-02-08;WOS:000423499200011;;

The study further augments the literature by extending the standard UIP hypothesis to account for the monetary policy stance and risk premium. The estimates of nonlinear autoregressive distributed lag (NARDL) and component generalised autoregressive conditional heteroscedasticity (C-GARCH) show that the UIP hypothesis does not exist in any of the BRICS economies. Nevertheless, after accounting for the risk premium and monetary policy stance using inflation levels, the interest rate differential significantly and positively influences the expected changes in the spot exchange rates. This indicates three important aspects: first, the necessity of risk premium to make up for the higher risk that comes with holding the foreign bond for the benefit of domestic investors. Second that the UIP puzzle does not hold, such that higher interest differential depreciates the domestic currency. Third, the analysis underscores the substantial and direct impact of US inflation level, particularly for Brazil, Russia and India, in determining the changes in the spot exchange rate. These insights hold crucial implications for policymakers and regulators.;;;;;;;;;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;;;0391-5026;1468-0300;;;;;;;;;;OP Jindal Global Univ, Jindal Sch Int Affairs, Sonipat, Haryana, India;;;;2024-12-21;WOS:001378643500001;;

Overall, we conclude that 1-year zero-coupon inflation swap rates are unbiased predictors of inflation rates. Further, there is no empirical evidence of an inflation risk premium and the assumption of rationality seems to hold. Definitely, these inferences encourage the reading of inflation expectations embedded in short-term inflation swaps. Additionally, we compare the predictive ability of inflation swaps with other measures of inflation expectations. The in-sample results show that, in contrast with surveys, market-based measures are able to accurately forecast inflation rates. In turn, based on an out-of-sample analysis, a straightforward econometric model dominates other sources. Therefore, a combined analysis that uses different sources contributes to a more robust view of future inflation rates.;;;;;;;;;3;0;0;0;0;0;3;;;0377-7332;1435-8921;;;;;;;;;;Banco Portugal, Econ & Res Dept, Av Almirante Reis 71,6th Floor, P-1150012 Lisbon, PortugalInst Univ Lisboa, ISCTE IUL, UNIDE, Complexo INDEG ISCTE,Av Prof Anibal Bettencourt, P-1600189 Lisbon, Portugal;;;;2018-05-22;WOS:000431930300003;;

As a key benchmark in global financial markets, the 10-year Treasury yield is influenced by multiple economic factors, including core inflation, the federal funds rate, GDP growth, and the U.S. Federal government's debt growth rate. Leveraging historical data from the Federal Reserve Economic Database (FRED), this study develops predictive models to assess the impact of these factors on yield fluctuations. Empirical results indicate that the random forest model outperforms the other approaches, achieving the lowest mean squared error (MSE) and mean absolute error (MAE), alongside an R-2 of 0.6073. This suggests its superior ability to capture nonlinear relationships in yield movements. The decision tree model also demonstrates competitive accuracy but is more susceptible to overfitting. Conversely, linear regression provides useful interpretability but struggles to capture complex economic interactions, leading to lower predictive accuracy. Despite its potential for handling nonlinear dependencies, the MLP model underperforms compared to the random forest, yielding an R-2 of 0.5058. The findings underscore the advantages of machine learning, particularly ensemble-based methods, in short-term Treasury yield forecasting.;;;;;;;;;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;;;1532-0626;1532-0634;;;;;;;;;;Penn State Univ, Mkt, State Coll, PA USANatl Taipei Univ Business, Inst Informat & Decis Sci, Taipei, Taiwan;;;;2025-10-08;WOS:001583369700020;;

We then develop two-factor and multi-factor nonparametric models that allow time variation in risk exposure and risk premium, and nonlinearity in the return generating process. When we assume that risk exposure can be time-varying but risk premium is constant, the estimated premium for exchange rate risk is significant only for the most positive FEI-ranked portfolio and marginally significant for the most negative FEI-ranked portfolio.

GARCH models rule this out by assumption. (ii) GARCH models impose parameter restrictions that are often violated by estimated coefficients and that may unduly restrict the dynamics of the conditional variance process. (iii) Interpreting whether shocks to conditional variance persist or not is difficult in GARCH models, because the usual norms measuring persistence often do not agree.

The analysis is based on an adaptive nonparametric modelling approach which allows for the data-driven estimation of the nonlinear dynamic relationship between portfolio credit risk premia and their hypothetical components. Our main finding is that the empirical weights of the systematic factors display sudden jumps during market crises and a less intense time-dependent behaviour during normal market conditions. In addition, we find that during market crises the directions of the empirical relationships are often inconsistent with ordinary economic intuition, as they are influenced by the specific circumstances of financial markets distress.

However, in some practical cases, for example, due to the absence of historical data, the inherent uncertain characteristic of risks or different subject judgements from the decision-makers, risks may be hard or not appropriate to be estimated with probability distributions. Therefore, the traditional probabilistic risk aversion theory is ineffective. Thus, in order to deal with these cases, we suggest measuring these kinds of risks as fuzzy variables, and accordingly to present an alternative risk aversion approach by employing credibility theory. In the present paper, first, the definition of credibilistic risk premium proposed by Georgescu and Kinnunen [Fuzzy Inf. Eng., 2013, 5, 399-416] is revised by taking the initial wealth into consideration, and then a general method to compute the credibilistic risk premium is provided. Secondly, regarding the risks represented with the commonly used LR fuzzy intervals, a simple calculation formula of the local credibilistic risk premium is put forward. Finally, in a global sense, several equivalent propositions for comparative risk aversion under the credibility measurement are provided.

Given that numerous macroeconomic variables can be used for term spread prediction, 116 variables are considered, and key variables are selected and extracted using LASSO. The core of the research lies in comparing two methodologies for predicting the term spread. The first method involves directly forecasting the spread itself, while the second method predicts long-term and short-term yields separately and then generates the spread from those predictions. The results indicate that the approach of directly predicting the term spread is statistically significantly superior. Our analysis effectively capture nonlinear characteristics, demonstrates particularly strong performance in financial time series forecasting. These findings provide an effective approach to predicting the term spread and may serve as an important foundation for future research.;;;;;;;;;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;;;1582-6163;2537-6071;;;;;;;;;;Sungkyunkwan Univ, Dept Econ, Seoul, South KoreaUniv Wollongong, Fac Business & Law, Wollongong, Australia;;;;2025-02-23;WOS:001421464600002;;

The purpose of this study is to reconsider the out-of-sample forecasting performance of structural time series processes relative to that of a random walk with or without drift. Design/methodology/approach This study uses bivariate vector autoregression and Markov switching representations to generate out-of-sample forecasts of ten-year sovereign bond yields, when the information set is augmented by including the growth rate of the monetary base, and the estimation relies on monthly data from countries that have pursued unconventional policies over the last decade. Findings The results show that naive forecasts are not better than those of structural time series models, based on root mean squared errors, while the Markov model provides additional information on price reversals, through probabilistic inferences regarding policy regime switches, which can induce agents to counteract QE interventions and reduce their effectiveness. Originality/value The novel features of this work are the use of a large information set including the instrument of unconventional monetary policy, the use of a structural model (Markov process) that can really inform about potential asset price reversals and the use of a large sample over which QE policies have been pursued.;;;;;;;;;2;0;0;0;0;0;2;;;1757-6385;1757-6393;;;;;;;;;;Hellen Mediterranean Univ, Dept Accounting & Finance, Iraklion, GreeceHellen Open Univ, Patras, Greece;;;;2022-10-18;WOS:000865510300001;;

To make decision-makers indifferent between a risky and risk-free option, the expected value of the risky option must exceed the value of the risk-free option by a certain amount-the risk premium. Previous psychological research suggests that similar to risk aversion, people dislike inconsistency in an interaction partner's behavior. In eight experiments (total N = 2,412) we pitted this inconsistency aversion against the expected returns from interacting with an inconsistent partner. We identified the additional expected return of interacting with an inconsistent partner that must be granted to make decision-makers prefer a more profitable, but inconsistent partner to a consistent, but less profitable one. We locate this inconsistency premium at around 31% of the expected value of the risk-free option.;;;;;;;;;2;0;0;0;1;0;2;;;0146-1672;1552-7433;;;;;;;;;;Univ Cologne, Cologne, Germany;;;;2021-04-24;WOS:000635991000001;33729049;

The forward looking information is extracted using implied risk-neutral density functions estimated by a mixture of two-lognormals and several alternative risk adjustments. Our results show that, between October 1996 and March 2000, we can reject the hypothesis that the risk-neutral densities provide accurate predictions of the distributions of future realisations of the IBEX 35 index at 4- and 8-week horizons. When forecasting through risk-adjusted densities the performance of this period is statistically improved and we no longer reject that hypothesis. We show that risk adjustments based on a power specification for the stochastic discount factor-which is the approach used so far in the literature that derives the objective density function from option prices- generates an excessive volatility of risk premia. We use alternative risk adjustments and find that the forecasting performance of the distribution improves slightly in some cases when risk aversion is allowed to be time-varying. Finally, from October 1996 to December 2004, the ex-ante risk premium perceived by investors and that are embedded in option prices is between 12 and 18% higher than the premium required to compensate the same investors for the realised volatility in stock market returns.;;;;;;;;;4;0;0;0;0;0;6;;;1435-5469;1435-5477;;;;;;;;;;Banco Espana, Serv Estudios, Madrid 28014, SpainUniv CEU Cardenal Herrera, Valencia, Spain;;;;2009-06-01;WOS:000265687100004;;

If a resource bust hits, the affected economies contract through declining export revenues, and possibly face increased default risk. Thus, both booms and busts can create macroeconomic instability. Using a dynamic growth model, we model regime changes which reveal nonlinear effects of debt on the economy, depending on the level of leveraging. We find a change from stable to unstable dynamics if the external debt to capital ratio rises above a certain threshold. Risk premia are introduced highlighting the state-dependent borrowing costs for the dynamic paths. We study excess debt and over-leveraging as deviations from sustainable ratios. We find country-specific risk premia that are likely associated with booms and busts for the given debt assessment.

However, previous studies have faced challenges in extracting hidden factors related to gold price prediction from diverse economic indicators, and the comprehensive exploration of gold price data is yet to be fully achieved. To address this, the present study introduces a mid to long-term gold price prediction model named DPformer. This model utilizes a patching strategy to investigate the relationships between different economic indicators and Gold Prices. It also employs a decomposition approach to discover the mid to long-term trend characteristics and yearly seasonal patterns of Gold Prices. The core of the model integrates a Transformer module, which is solely based on an Encoder structure, and enhances it with multiple attention mechanisms and convolutions. This enhancement allows the improved Transformer model to more effectively capture the long-term dependencies of Gold Prices. The empirical results demonstrate that DPformer consistently outperforms a suite of advanced models widely adopted in terms of mid to long-term forecasting accuracy, including LSTM, GRU, Transformer, DLinear, and PatchTST. Notably, for the 30-step gold price prediction task, DPformer achieves a 21.78% reduction in Mean Squared Error compared to PatchTST. Moreover, by quantitatively analyzing how various economic indicators influence gold price forecasts, this study provides substantial support for investors in making informed decisions at critical moments.;;;;;;;;;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;;;0957-4174;1873-6793;;;;;;;;;;George Washington Univ, Columbian Coll Arts & Sci, Dept Econ, Washington, DC USAChongqing Univ, State Key Lab Power Transmiss Equipment Technol, Chongqing, Peoples R ChinaShanghai Normal Univ, Sch Finance & Business, Dept Finance, Shanghai, Peoples R ChinaSouthwestern Univ Finance & Econ, Inst Chinese Finance Studies, Chengdu, Peoples R China;;;;2025-10-09;WOS:001583846100016;;

To overcome many of the well-known concerns by adopting the financial option pricing techniques for modeling real options problems such as replicating portfolio concept, geometric Brownian motion as underlying stochastic process, and estimating project volatility, we propose an alternative real option valuation based on the loss function approach. The option value determined by the loss function approach is equivalent to the expected value of perfect information (EVPI) in decision analysis. It basically sets the upper bound of risk premium to pay in retaining the options. In practice, many firms utilize the concept of Value at Risk to manage their portfolio risk. If a firm sets a target VAR, then we may be able to link this VAR in refining the actual risk premium to pay in hedging the risk embedded in the investment. With this practice in mind, we present a logic to figure out an appropriate amount of real option premium to pay for a given level of risk tolerance. A comprehensive example is presented to demonstrate the computational procedures as well as economic interpretations on the outcomes.;;;;;;;;;2;0;0;0;0;0;2;;;0013-791X;1547-2701;;;;;;;;;;Auburn Univ, Ind & Syst Engn, Auburn, AL 36849 USARepubl Korea Army, Seoul, South Korea;Republ Korea Army;;;2021-01-22;WOS:000606888000001;;

We propose two potential channels for the positive effect of foreign residency rights on corporate bond yield spreads: increasing firms' earnings management and taking more risk. Further, stronger external governance and internal governance alleviate the positive effects of foreign residency rights on corporate bond yield spreads. Additional analyses indicate that ultimate controllers with overseas residency rights are associated with more bond covenants, higher bank loan spreads and shorter loan maturity. Overall, our results indicate that corporate bondholders are fully aware of the expropriation risk created by controllers' foreign residency rights.

The model implies that reducing the levels of capacity constraints can alleviate the influences of heterogeneous beliefs and helps to stabilize financial markets. The model also reveals that introducing heterogeneous beliefs about both real and nominal sectors not only leads the stock with low monetary policy exposure to have significantly higher average return than the stock with high monetary policy exposure, but also can explain the mixed results about the relationship between the volatility and the risk premium of the aggregate stock market.;;;;;;;;;1;0;0;0;0;0;1;;;1062-9408;1879-0860;;;;;;;;;;Jiangxi Normal Univ, Coll Finance, Nanchang 330031, Peoples R ChinaNanchang Univ, Sch Econ & Management, Nanchang 330031, Peoples R China;;;;2024-05-20;WOS:001222099900001;;

Hyperparameter tuning through grid search and randomized search was used to optimize model performance. The results demonstrated the efficacy of AI/ML algorithms in predicting temporal, spatial, and industry-specific money-laundering patterns. The random forest classifier achieved 99.99% average accuracy in state prediction, while the gradient boosting regressor and random forest classifier excelled in predicting year and state simultaneously, and credit card transactions, respectively. MLP and CNN showed promise in the context of debit card transactions. The gradient boosting regressor performed competitively with low mean squared error (MSE) (2.9) and the highest R-squared (R2) value of 0.24, showcasing its pattern-capturing proficiency. Logistic regression and random forest classifier performed well in predicting credit card transactions, with area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC_AUC) scores of 0.55 and 0.53, respectively.

The restrictions promote parsimony by reducing the dimension of the drifting component in conditional mean parameters. As an application, the paper investigates an anticipatedutility version of the expectations model of the term structure. The estimates suggest that changing beliefs matter for understanding the yield curve and point to an intriguing clue about risk premia. Local approximations to the mean yield spread are highly correlated with the variance of the trend short rate, suggesting a connection between uncertainty about the long-run target of monetary policy and risk premia on long-term bonds.

Our empirical tests on the S&P 500, Dow Jones Industrial Average and Nasdaq 100 indices over long time series of more than 20 years of daily data indicate that an implied volatility based Value-at-Risk cannot beat, and tends to be outperformed by, a simple GJR-GARCH based Value-at-Risk. This finding is robust to the use of the likelihood ratio, the dynamic quantile test or a statistical loss function for evaluating the Value-at-Risk performance.The poor performance of the option based Value-at-Risk is due to the volatility risk premium embedded in implied volatilities. We apply both non-parametric and parametric adjustments to correct for the negative price of the volatility risk. However, although this adjustment is effective in reducing the bias, it still does not allow the implied volatility to outperform the historical volatility models.These results are in contrast to the volatility forecasting literature, which favors implied volatilities over the historical volatility model. We show that forecasting the volatility and forecasting a quantile of the return distribution are two different objectives. While the implied volatility is useful for the earlier objective function, it is not for the latter, due to the non-linear and regime changing dynamics of the volatility risk premium.

This paper proposes MSFCE, a novel framework for stock market trend prediction that enhances feature correlations across multi-time-span sequences. Specifically, MSFCE designs a multi-scale feature encoder to capture both intraday and daily features, which are processed through a Transformer-based dimensionally adaptive encoder. Furthermore, the framework leverages higher-order interactions among technical indicators via a graph attention network, dynamically modeling their interdependencies to improve prediction robustness in dynamic markets. Extensive experiments on the SSE50 and CSI300 datasets demonstrate that MSFCE significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods, consistently exhibiting superior performance across multiple test periods and market conditions. Its strong prediction accuracy and risk management suggest practical applicability in trading strategies, yielding significant excess returns in empirical backtests.;;;;;;;;;3;0;0;0;0;0;3;;;0925-2312;1872-8286;;;;;;;;;;Beijing Univ Posts & Telecommun, Sch Econ & Management, Beijing 100876, Peoples R ChinaBeijing Univ Posts & Telecommun, Sch Comp Sci, Natl Pilot Software Engn Sch, Beijing 100876, Peoples R ChinaUniv Sci & Technol Beijing, Sch Econ & Management, Beijing 100083, Peoples R China;;;;2025-02-09;WOS:001412469500001;;

To predict sentence sentiment, prior monetary policy decision text was used as input for classification models. The sentence sentiment prediction model showed 83.7% performance when using a support vector machine. In addition, it was observed that the bigrams extracted from documents provided important descriptions of the Korean economy at the time. Finally, the document sentiment of monetary policy decision was calculated using aggregating sentence sentiment, and the vote results were predicted using this sentiment. As a result, when using the support vector machine to predict the Monetary Policy Committee vote results, the performance improved by 29.5% over the baseline model.

Our results suggest that Japanese long-term inflation expectations have remained pos-itive despite extensive spells of deflation, leaving inflation risk premia mostly negative during this period.

Forecasting results are superior when constrained ensemble models are used vis-a-vis unregularized machine learning techniques. In a mean-reversion strategy, our IV-sentiment measure delivers economically significant results, with limited exposure to a set of cross-sectional equity factors, including Fama and French's five factors, the momentum factor and the low-volatility factor, and seems valuable in preventing momentum crashes.

Empirical asset pricing is a challenging task in financial analysis, which has attracted research attention. However, existing studies only focus on tackling the challenges of equity risk premium in the single stock market. Considering multiple economic linkages between the two countries, the transaction history of the US stock market as empirical knowledge is a powerful supplement to improve the prediction of equity risk premium in the China market. In this paper, we aim to fully leverage the prior information in two stock markets for empirical asset pricing models. Due to the rich financial domain knowledge, there may be various characteristic signals that partially overlap in different periods. To address these issues, we propose a framework based on long-short dual-mode knowledge distillation, termed as LSDM-KD, which incorporates US and China stock market models, and a shared characteristic signals model. The method effectively understands the relationships between assets and market behaviour, reducing reliance on expensive correlation databases and professional knowledge. Extensive experiments conducted on US and China stock market datasets demonstrate that our LSDM-KD can significantly improve the performance of empirical asset pricing.;;;;;;;;;2;0;0;0;0;0;3;;;0954-0091;1360-0494;;;;;;;;;;Huazhong Univ Sci & Technol, Sch Journalism & Informat Commun, Wuhan 430074, Peoples R ChinaHuazhong Univ Sci & Technol, Sch Cyber Sci & Engn, Wuhan, Peoples R ChinaZhongnan Univ Econ & Law, Sch Informat & Safety Engn, Wuhan, Peoples R ChinaImperial Coll London, Imperial Coll Business Sch, London, EnglandWuhan Res Inst Post & Telecommun, Wuhan, Peoples R ChinaHuazhong Univ Sci & Technol, Sch Comp Sci & Technol, Wuhan, Peoples R China;;;;2024-02-02;WOS:001148696100001;;

One criticism of these conclusions is that these benchmarks are ill suited to handle the extreme statistical nature of option returns generated by nonlinear payoffs. We propose an alternative way to evaluate the statistical significance of option returns by comparing historical statistics to those generated by option pricing models. The most puzzling finding in the existing literature, the large returns to writing out-of-the-money puts, is not inconsistent (i.e., is statistically insignificant) relative to the Black-Scholes model or the Heston stochastic volatility model due to the extreme sampling uncertainty associated with put returns. This sampling problem can largely be alleviated by analyzing market-neutral portfolios such as straddles or delta-hedged returns. The returns on these portfolios can be explained by jump risk premiums and estimation risk.

Besides, in order to capture dynamic interaction between yield curve and macroeconomic/financial factors, a panel vector autoregressive (VAR) analysis based on the system generalized method of moments (GMM) approach is utilized. Empirical results suggest that the level factor responds to shocks originated from inflation, domestic financial variables, and global variables. Furthermore, the slope factor is affected by shocks in global variables, and the curvature factor appears to be influenced by domestic financial variables.

Empirical studies using either the proxy approach or the VR method conclude that barrier-independent models significantly underestimate corporate bond yields. Although barrier-dependent models tend to overestimate the yield on average, they generate a sizable degree of underestimation. The present paper shows that the proxy approach is an upwardly biased estimator of the corporate assets and makes the empirical framework work systematically against structural models of corporate bond pricing. The VR approach may generate inconsistent corporate bond prices or may fail to give a positive corporate bond price for some structural models. When the Merton, LS, BD and LT models are implemented with ML estimation, we find substantial improvement in their performances. Our empirical analysis shows that the LT model is very accurate for predicting short-term bond yields, whereas the LS and BD models are good predictors for medium-term and long-term bonds. The Merton model however significantly overestimates short-term bond yields and underestimates long-term bond yields. Unlike empirical studies in the past, the Merton model implemented with ML estimation does not consistently underestimate corporate bond yields. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

Automatic procedures to upgrade or downgrade risk exposure could potentially improve long term performance for such products. The risk and return of bonds is more easy to predict than the risk and return of stocks. This and the well known stock-bond correlation motivates the inclusion of the current bond yield in a model for the prediction of excess stock returns. Here, we take the actuarial long term view using yearly data, and focus on nonlinear relationships between a set of covariates. We employ fully nonparametric models and apply for estimation a local-linear kernel smoother. Since the current bond yield is not known, it is predicted in a prior step. The structure imposed this way in the final estimation process helps to circumvent the curse of dimensionality and reduces bias in the estimation of excess stock returns. Our validated stock prediction results show that predicted bond returns improve stock prediction significantly. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Especially, the neural network of the two layers with sigmoid function presents the best performance for the period of 3 months and 6 months, respectively.

In this paper we conduct a series of numerical simulation experiments to investigate the quantitative significance of climate response uncertainty for economic assessments of climate change. First we characterize climate uncertainty by constructing two probability density functions-a Bayesian model-averaged and a Bayesian updated version-based on a combination of uncertainty ranges for climate sensitivity reported in the scientific literature. Next we estimate the willingness to pay of a representative agent for a range of emissions reduction policies using two simplified economic models. Our results illustrate the potential for large risk premiums in benefits estimates as suggested by the recent theoretical work on climate response uncertainty, and they show that the size and even the sign of the risk premium may depend crucially on how the posterior distribution describing the overall climate sensitivity uncertainty is constructed and on the specific shape of the damage function.;;;;;;;;;35;0;0;0;5;0;41;;;0924-6460;1573-1502;;;;;;;;;;US EPA, Natl Ctr Environm Econ, Washington, DC 20460 USAUS EPA, Climate Change Div, Washington, DC 20460 USAClimate Change Div, US EPA, Washington, DC USA;;;;2009-11-01;WOS:000271445400004;;

This study evaluated the economic feasibility and estimated the risk premium of 12 rainfed soybean production systems with various planting densities, fertilization rates and planting patterns by considering the impact of soybean price fluctuation. There were two planting densities (D1: 160,000 plants ha-1 and D2: 320,000 plants ha-1), two fertilization rates (F1: 20 kg ha-1 N, 30 kg ha-1 P, 30 kg ha-1 K; F2: 40 kg ha-1 N, 60 kg ha-1 P, 60 kg ha-1 K) and three planting patterns (F+W0: flat cultivation with no irrigation; R+W0: plastic-mulched ridge-furrow cultivation (PMRF) with no irrigation; R+W1: PMRF with supplemental irrigation of 30 mm at the pod-filling stage). Based on the two-year (2019-2020) field data in a semi-humid drought-prone region of northwest China and soybean price fluctuation from January 2014 to June 2021, the net income (NI) was calculated by considering the impact of soybean price fluctuation and assuming constant soybean production costs. The net present value (NPV) method and the stochastic efficiency with respect to a function (SERF) method were used to evaluate the profitability of protective alternatives and the risk of these alternatives. The results showed that the 12 proposed soybean production systems were economically feasible. Reducing the fertilization rate reduced the input costs, but it did not necessarily result in a decrease in soybean yield and NI. The payback period of all production systems was within two years for farmers investing through loans. High-fertilizer and high-density production systems made personal investment obtain the highest economic benefit in this study, which was not the best investment strategy from the perspective of production-to-investment ratio and environmental protection departments. The preferences of farmers with various risk aversion and environmental protection departments in terms of risk premium were also proposed. The economic and risk assessment framework of this study can enhance the understanding of the adjustment of production systems from different perspectives, and provide strategies for promoting the protection of economic, environmental and socially sustainable agricultural systems.";;;;;;;;;2;0;0;0;0;1;3;;;;2073-4395;;;;;;;;;;Northwest A&F Univ, Key Lab Agr Soil & Water Engn Arid & Semiarid Area, Minist Educ, Xianyang 712100, Peoples R China;;;;2023-12-19;WOS:001119856400001;;

Particularly, this empirical study evaluates risk aversion spillover dynamics as an uncertainty transmission mechanism for the period 2000-2015 to reveal if there has been a significant change in these dynamics when markets are going through turbulent periods. As a plausible proxy for risk aversion, variance risk premium (VRP) is computed through the difference between expected variances under risk-neutral and physical measures for seven markets studied: United States, United Kingdom, Germany, France, Netherlands, Switzerland and Japan. Effects of a shock to U.S. VRP on the other markets' VRPs are evaluated through Generalized Forecast Error Variance Decomposition. Results show that risk aversion spillovers from U.S. to other markets are stronger while the U.S. is going through turbulent periods confirming the intuition that investors are more focused on incidents in the turbulent market.

Specifically, we employ the differences among estimates and impulse response functions across linear and nonlinear models to identify and measure cross-asset contagion. An application to weekly Eurozone data for a 2007-2014 sample reveals that a two-state Markov switching model shows economically weak, though accurately estimated, contagion effects in a crisis regime. These findings are mainly explained by a flight-to-quality channel. Furthermore, we extend our analysis to explore whether European markets may or may not have been subject to contagion when exposed to external shocks, such as those originated from the US subprime crisis.

We specify a joint shadow rate term structure model for the risk-free, the German, and the Italian sovereign yield curves. In our model, the behavior of long-term spreads becomes strongly nonlinear in the underlying factors when interest rates are close to the lower bound, which occurs in the data since the beginning of 2012. We fit the model via Quasi-Maximum Likelihood and show three consequences of the nonlinear behavior of sovereign spreads: (i) they are asymmetrically distributed, (ii) they are affected by (possibly exogenous) changes in the lower bound, and (iii) they become less informative about sovereign risk than when interest rates are far from the lower bound. Shadow spreads, however, still provide reliable information. (C) 2020 The Author(s).

And this article defines three factors of the term structure of credit spreads: level, slope and curvature. Based on these three factors and several macroeconomic variables, VAR models are developed and tested to forecast macroeconomic variables. The empirical results confirm that VAR models can predict the changes of China's macroeconomy well, which indicates that the term structure of credit spreads contains information of future changes of macroeconomic variables.

Option and spot market information on the latent variance process is captured by using dual 'model-free' variance measures to define a bivariate observation equation in the state space model. The premium for variance diffusive risk is defined as linear in the latent variance (in the usual fashion) whilst the premium for variance jump risk is specified as a conditionally deterministic dynamic process, driven by a function of past measurements. The inferential approach adopted is Bayesian, implemented via a Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm that caters for the multiple sources of non-linearity in the model and for the bivariate measure. The method is applied to spot and option price data on the S&P500 index from 1999 to 2008, with conclusions drawn about investors' required compensation for variance risk during the recent financial turmoil. The accuracy of the probabilistic forecasts of the observable variance measures is demonstrated, and compared with that of forecasts yielded by alternative methods. To illustrate the benefits of the approach, it is used to produce forecasts of prices of derivatives on volatility itself. In addition, the posterior distribution is augmented by information on daily returns to produce value at risk predictions. Linking the variance risk premia to the risk aversion parameter in a representative agent model, probabilistic forecasts of (approximate) relative risk aversion are also produced.

The sustainable investment attribute of green bonds has been favored by investors, so that green bonds have become an important component for major asset allocation. However, due to the specific investment focus of green bonds, investors' return expectations are influenced not only by traditional corporate bond factors, but also by related factors such as climate change and energy transition. Against the backdrop of increasingly severe climate risks and the global energy crisis, this paper analyses the volatility characteristics of China's green bonds at multiple time scales, and introduces exogenous variables such as returns of the alternative financial assets, climate risks and returns of energy markets for prediction. Based on the LSTM model, the volatility of green bond yield at different time scales is separately predicted using optimal exogenous variable before integration. It is found that the new integrated prediction model can significantly improve the forecasting performance compared to traditional single LSTM models and simple decomposition-integrated models. Further, both climate risks and energy markets variables have a significant improvement effect on predicting green bond in low-frequency item, while energy markets variables also have a better predictive effect on trend items. Building on the use of only LSTM model, it could be further enhanced by integrating more algorithms to select the best single model for each component, further improve the prediction accuracy and provide a more effective quantitative tool for investment decision-making and risk management in related fields.;;;;;;;;;1;0;0;0;0;0;2;;;;2296-665X;;;;;;;;;;Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Sch Econ & Management, Beijing, Peoples R ChinaChinese Acad Sci, Res Ctr Fictitious Econ & Data Sci, Beijing, Peoples R China;;;;2024-01-07;WOS:001133228900001;;

Empirical studies demonstrate that the proposed TCN-iTransformer model outperforms existing methods in both point prediction and interval prediction, exhibiting excellent prediction interval coverage probability and normalized average width at different confidence intervals. The Diebold-Mariano (DM) test and ordinary least squares (OLS) regression analysis further validate the predictive advantages of the proposed model.

The SGDCT algorithm follows a (noisy) descent direction along a continuous stream of data. SGDCT performs an online parameter update in continuous time with the parameter updates theta(t) satisfying a stochastic differential equation. We prove that lim(t ->infinity) del(g) over bar(theta(t)) = 0, where (g) over bar is is a natural objective function for the estimation of the continuous-time dynamics. The convergence proof leverages ergodicity by using an appropriate Poisson equation to help describe the evolution of the parameters for large times. For certain continuous-time problems, SGDCT has some promising advantages compared to a traditional stochastic gradient descent algorithm. This paper mainly focuses on applications in finance, such as model estimation for stocks, bonds, interest rates, and financial derivatives. SGDCT can also be used for the optimization of high-dimensional continuous time models, such as American options. As an example application, SGDCT is combined with a deep neural network to price high-dimensional American options (up to 100 dimensions).;;;;;;;;;31;1;0;0;1;1;41;;;1945-497X;;;;;;;;;;;Univ Illinois, Dept Ind & Enterprise Syst Engn, Urbana, IL 61801 USABoston Univ, Dept Math & Stat, Boston, MA 02215 USA;;;;2018-01-16;WOS:000418651600030;;

These data enable investors to understand the credit levels of debtors from a bank perspective; this facilitates predicting the debtor default rate to efficiently evaluate investment risks. The paper aims to discuss these issues.Design/methodology/approachA credit rating model can be developed to reduce the risk of adverse selection and moral hazard caused by information asymmetry in the loan market. In this study, a random forest (RF) was used to evaluate financial variables and construct credit rating prediction models. Data-mining techniques, including an RF, decision tree, neural networks, and support vector machine, were used to search for suitable credit rating forecasting methods. The distance to default from the KMV model was then incorporated into the credit rating model as a research variable to increase predictive power of various data-mining techniques. In addition, four-level and nine-level classification were set to investigate the accuracy rates of various models.FindingsThe experimental results indicated that applying the RF in the variable feature selection process and developing a forecasting model was the most effective method of predicting credit ratings; the four-level and nine-level feature-selection settings achieved 95.5 and 87.8 percent accuracy rates, respectively, indicating that RF demonstrated outstanding feature selection and forecasting capacity.Research limitations/implicationsThe experimental cases were based on financial data from public companies in North America.Practical implicationsPractical implication of this study indicates the most effective financial variables were dividends common/ordinary, cash dividends, volatility assumption, and risk-free rate assumption.Originality/valueThe RF model can be used to perform feature selection and efficiently filter numerous financial variables to obtain crediting rating information instantly.";;;;;;;;;10;0;0;0;1;0;10;;;0368-492X;1758-7883;;;;;;;;;;Natl Chung Cheng Univ, Dept Accounting & Informat Technol, Min Hsiung Township, Taiwan;;;;2016-11-07;WOS:000530317200010;;

The paper models and estimates the different relationships that can exist in different ranges of behaviour.

To take into account nonlinear relationships and different structures of dependency, we employ three Archimedean copula functions: Gumbel, Clayton, and Frank. We adopt nonparametric estimation of copula parameters and we find an extreme co-movement of CDS and stock market conditions. In addition, tail dependence indicates the extreme co-movements and the potential for a simultaneous large loss in stock markets and a significant default risk. Ignoring the tail dependence would lead to underestimation of the default risk premium. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

Furthermore, the strength of the predictive evidence is substantial during relatively high and low level of stock market, while is substantially higher for recessions vis-a-vis expansions. Oil VRP can also contains additional information for predicting a series of macroeconomic variables, which serves as an available explanation for its forecasting ability. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

This paper examines whether an earlier inception of such purchases (OMT) could have prevented the observed Greek repudiation. To account for the extraordinary circumstances surrounding the Greek default, I construct a novel model of sovereign finance in which default is political and investors' reliance on external credit ratings gives rise to slow moving crises. Estimating the model with Greek data, I find that an earlier inception of OMT plausibly could have prevented the observed default, but the resulting counterfactual Greek state would have been so fragile that, absent any further fiscal consolidation, eventual default was effectively inevitable. Moreover, the present Greek state remains sufficiently fragile that a quick return to a predominantly private financing scheme is not advisable.;;;;;;;;;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;;;1059-0560;1873-8036;;;;;;;;;;Univ San Diego, Knauss Sch Business, San Diego, CA 92110 USA;;;;2025-08-15;WOS:001544989200002;;

Our Nonlinear Quadratic Model (NLQ) model has three dynamic state equations and a quadratic objective function. It can be used to evaluate the response of central banks to the Great Recession in moving from conventional to unconventional monetary policy.

Following the popular copula-GARCH approach for modeling dependent MTS data, a framework based on a GMMN-GARCH approach is presented. First, ARMA-GARCH models are utilized to capture the serial dependence within each univariate marginal time series. Second, if the number of marginal time series is large, principal component analysis (PCA) is used as a dimension-reduction step. Last, the remaining cross-sectional dependence is modeled via a GMMN, the main contribution of this work. GMMNs are highly flexible and easy to simulate from, which is a major advantage over the copula-GARCH approach. Applications involving yield curve modeling and the analysis of foreign exchange-rate returns demonstrate the utility of the GMMN-GARCH approach, especially in terms of producing better empirical predictive distributions and making better probabilistic forecasts.(c) 2021 EcoSta Econometrics and Statistics.

First uncertainty is transformed into a risk measure by extracting damage distribution means and variances from an ensemble of socio economic and climate change scenarios. Then a risk premium is computed under different degrees of risk aversion, quantifying what society would be willing to pay to insure against the uncertainty of the damages. Our estimates show that the premium for the risk is a potentially significant addition to the standard average damage, but highly sensitive to the attitudes toward risk. In the last research phase, the risk premium is incorporated into the climate change damage function of a widely used IAM which shows, consequently, a substantial increase in both mitigation and adaptation efforts, reflecting a more precautionary attitude by the social planner. Interestingly, adaptation is stimulated more than mitigation in the first half of this century, while the situation reverses afterwards.;;;;;;;;;3;0;0;0;0;0;3;;;0924-6460;1573-1502;;;;;;;;;;Univ Basque Country, Basque Ctr Climate Change, Sci Campus, Leioa 48940, SpainUniv Venice Ca Foscari, Dept Econ, Cannaregio 873, I-30121 Venice, ItalyFdn Euromediterranean Ctr Climate Change, Via Augusto Imperatore 16-1, I-73100 Lecce, ItalyUniv Bordeaux, CNRS, UMR 5805, EPOC, Allee Geoffroy St Hilaire,Bat B18 N, F-33615 Pessac, FranceUniv Milan, Dept Environmnental Sci & Policy, Via Celoria 2, I-20133 Milan, Italy;;;;2020-01-28;WOS:000507500300009;;

Maximizing entropy in a random time change delivers the symmetric variance gamma model. The asymmetric variance gamma follows on incorporating skewness. Differential speeds for the upward and downward motions lead to the bilateral gamma. A further generalizations results in the bilateral double gamma model when the speed parameter of the bilateral gamma model is itself taken to be gamma distributed on entropy maximization. A rich five to seven parameter specification of preferences renders possible the extraction of physical densities from option prices. The quality of such extraction is measured by examining the uniformity of the estimated distribution functions evaluated at realized forward returns. The economic value of risky returns is seen to embed three/five risk premia for the bilateral gamma/bilateral double gamma. For the bilateral gamma they are up and down side volatilities compensated in up and down side drifts, and the down side drift compensated in the up side drift. For the bilateral double gamma one adds in addition compensations for skewness. Results reveal a drop in the down side risk premiumsince the crisis with an increase in the recent period.;;;;;;;;;14;0;0;0;0;0;21;;;2345-7686;2382-5596;;;;;;;;;;Univ Maryland, Robert H Smith Sch Business, College Pk, MD 20742 USAKatholieke Univ Leuven, Dept Math, Leuven, BelgiumMorgan Stanley, Derivat Prod Strats, 1585 Broadway,5th Floor, New York, NY 10036 USA;;;;2020-04-14;WOS:000522819500008;;

To relax this assumption, we model the strongly correlated covariates by a factor structure: strong correlations among covariates are modeled by common factors, while the remaining variations of covariates are modeled as idiosyncratic components. We then propose a factor-adjusted sparse regression model and develop a semi-Bayesian estimation method for it. Posterior contraction rate and model selection consistency are established by a non-asymptotic analysis. Experimental studies show that the proposed method outperforms its Lasso analogue, manifests insensitivity to overestimates of the number of common factors, pays a negligible price when covariates are uncorrelated, scales up well with increasing sample size, dimensionality and sparsity, and converges fast to the posterior distribution. An application to the U.S. bond risk premia lends further support to the proposed model and method.

In the last years regulators introduced, with the Solvency II directive, a market consistent valuation framework for determining the fair value of asset and liabilities of insurance funds. A relevant aspect is how to deal with the estimation of sovereign credit and liquidity risk, that are important components in the valuation of the majority of insurance funds, which are usually heavily invested in treasury bonds. The common practice is the adoption of the certainty equivalent approach (CEQ) for the risk neutral evaluation of insurance liabilities, which results in a deterministic risk adjustment of the securities cash flows. In this paper, we propose an arbitrage free stochastic model for interest rate, credit and liquidity risks, that takes into account the dependences between different government bond issuers. We test the impact of the common practice against our proposed model, via Monte Carlo simulations. We conclude that in the estimation of options whose pay-off is determined by statutory accounting rules, which is often the case for European traditional with-profit insurance products, the deterministic adjustment for risk of the securities cash flows is not appropriate, and that a more complete model such as the one described in this article is a viable and sensible alternative in the context of market consistent evaluations.

We show that for known values of beta i and when phi is non-zero, there exist phi-portfolios that dominate mean-variance (MV) portfolios.

Small sample results from extensive Monte Carlo experiments show that the proposed estimator has the correct size with good power properties.

Meanwhile, various risk measurements such as variance, entropy, and Value-at-Risk have been proposed in fuzzy environments to evaluate investment risks from different perspectives. Sharpe ratio, also known as the reward-to-variability ratio, which measures the risk premium per unit of the nonsystematic risk (asset deviation), has received great attention in modern portfolio theory. In this study, the Sharpe ratio in fuzzy environments is introduced, whereafter, a fuzzy Value-at-Risk ratio is proposed. Compared with Sharpe ratio, Value-at-Risk ratio is an index with dimensional knowledge that reflects the risk premium per unit of the systematic risk (the greatest loss under a given confidence level). On the basis of the two ratios, a multi-objective model is built to evaluate their joint impact on portfolio selection. Then, the proposed model is solved by a fuzzy simulation based multi-objective particle swarm optimization algorithm, where the global best of each iteration is determined by an improved dominance times based method. Finally, the algorithm superiority is justified via comparing with existing solvers on benchmark problems, and the model effectiveness is exemplified by using three case studies on portfolio selection.;;;;;;;;;45;3;0;0;1;0;53;;;1063-6706;1941-0034;;;;;;;;;;Nanjing Univ, Sch Management & Engn, Nanjing 210008, Peoples R ChinaNanjing Univ Finance & Econ, Sch Finance, Nanjing 210003, Peoples R ChinaUniv Chinese Acad Sci, Sch Econ & Management, Beijing 101408, Peoples R ChinaUniv Teknol PETRONAS, Dept Comp & Informat Sci, Seri Iskandar 32610, Malaysia;;;;2018-12-28;WOS:000451946300039;;

Next, we apply the methodologies to analyze the dynamic forecasting relationship between zero-coupon bond returns and MPU from 1985 to 2022. We find that MPU significantly and positively predicts bond returns in over 75% of the sample period, with the strongest effect observed in 2005. Thus, the expectations hypothesis is only transiently valid. After controlling for the shape of the yield curve, MPU still retains its ability to predict bond returns in 50% to 80% of the sample period. Our conclusions are robust to the so-called embedded endogeneity. Additionally, we find that bond excess returns are less responsive to MPU during periods of high economic activities and are more responsive during periods of low economic activities.;;;;;;;;;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;;;1057-5219;1873-8079;;;;;;;;;;Xiangtan Univ, Business Sch, Taiping Rd, Xiangtan 411105, Peoples R ChinaHunan Univ, Coll Finance & Stat, 109 Shijiachong Rd, Changsha 410006, Peoples R China;;;;2025-08-08;WOS:001540561800003;;

Recent metrics, such as dynamic Initial Margin (IM) and Margin Value Adjustments (MVA) additionally require the simulation of future conditional sensitivities. For portfolios with non-linear instruments that do not admit closed-form valuation formulas, this poses a significant computational challenge. This problem is addressed by proposing a static replication algorithm for interest rate options with early-exercise features under an affine term-structure model. Under the appropriate conditions, we can find an equivalent portfolio of vanilla options that replicate these products. Specifically, we decompose the product into a portfolio of European swaptions. The weights and strikes of the portfolio are obtained by regressing the target option value with interpretable, feed-forward neural networks. Once an equivalent portfolio of European swaptions is determined, we can leverage on closed-form expressions to obtain the conditional prices and sensitivities, which serve as an input to exposure and SIMM-driven MVA quantification. For a consistent forward sensitivity estimation, this involves the differentiation of the portfolio-weights. The accuracy and convergence of the method is demonstrated through several representative numerical examples, benchmarked against the established least-square Monte Carlo method.;;;;;;;;;1;0;0;0;0;0;1;;;1469-7688;1469-7696;;;;;;;;;;Univ Amsterdam, Computat Sci Lab, Sci Pk 904, NL-1098XH Amsterdam, NetherlandsIndian Inst Sci, Dept Management Studies, Bangalore, IndiaING Bank, Quantitat Analyt, Foppingadreef 7, NL-1102 BD Amsterdam, Netherlands;;;;2024-03-10;WOS:001170161200001;;

Using an extensive dataset, comprising 3-month, 1-year, 5-year and 10-year constant maturity Treasury bonds for the Eurozone southern periphery countries - the so-called PIIGS - from January 1999 to April 2019, we investigate the links between bond yields of different maturities for the Eurozone southern peripheral countries and we find they co-evolve in line with the predictions of the Expectations Hypothesis theory. We demonstrate the presence of nonlinearities in the term structure, and utilize a multivariate asymmetric two-regime Markov-switching VAR methodology to model them properly. Moreover, we address the economic reasoning behind the introduction of an equilibrium-correction regime-switching approach, hence providing potentially important insights on the behaviour of the entire yield curve. We reveal that the regime shifts are related to the state of the business cycle, particularly in economies in which monetary policy decisions are implemented via changes in short-term rates as a response to deviations of output from equilibrium levels.

Through the analysis and research of related indexes, the change rules of different indexes are obtained, and the optimization model is used to calculate and forecast the excess return of stocks. The results show that the statistics and spectral radius show typical local linear variation with the increase of eigenvalue. The corresponding statistics show a trend of gradual increase. The corresponding spectral radius has a decreasing variation law, and the two curves have obvious symmetry at some eigenvalues. It can be seen from the change curves under different factors that the change trend of the yield curve is mainly affected by the investment factor, while the change rule of the specific value of the yield curve is controlled by the profit factor. This shows that the two factors have the same influence on the stock excess return. The influence of optimized deep learning model on stock excess index has typical linear characteristics, which can be divided into linear increase and linear decline according to different change rules. The basic type has the greatest influence, while the corresponding pattern analysis type has the least influence. Finally, the method of experimental verification is used to verify the stock excess data, and the results show that the optimized deep learning model can better characterize the experimental results. Therefore, the optimized deep learning model based on nonlinear random matrix and esg factor can carry out targeted analysis of different types of stock returns, thus improving research ideas and calculation methods for the application of deep learning model in different fields.;;;;;;;;;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;;;1024-123X;1563-5147;;;;;;;;;;Univ Putra Malaysia, Sch Business & Econ, Serdang 43400, MalaysiaShanghai Univ Finance, Econ Zhejiang Coll, Jinhua 321000, Zhejiang, Peoples R ChinaYuncheng Univ, Yuncheng 044000, Shanxi, Peoples R China;Shanghai Univ Finance;;;2022-10-21;WOS:000864070000004;;

We study whether emissions are priced by financial markets, providing a market-based incentive for firms to reduce their carbon footprints and if the heightened attention on climate change postParis Accord (PA) impacts the size of the carbon risk premium. We focus on electricity generators, because they are responsible for the largest share of emissions and emissions reductions in the U.S. and are highly exposed to regulatory, physical, and stranded asset risks. We find the cost of carbon risk is reflected in the returns of vertically integrated electric utilities. The post-PA period provides the strongest evidence that carbon risk is priced. We find that equity markets provide incentives for power producers to reduce emissions, as reductions in emissions are associated with reductions in required returns on equity (increases in equity market values). The challenge for regulators is how to respond in rate cases. Lowering a utility's regulated return to reflect lower market estimates of the return on equity would dilute the market-based incentive for emissions reductions. Adding a longer-term return incentive for continued investment in emissions reductions would reinforce the market incentive.;;;;;;;;;2;0;0;0;0;0;2;;;0301-4215;1873-6777;;;;;;;;;;Rutgers State Univ, Sch Business Camden, 227 Penn St, Camden, NJ 08102 USA;;;;2025-01-29;WOS:001403068500001;;

Our aim is to illustrate empirically a net of interactions existing among the major bond markets of Europe and the US market taking into account shifts in the underlying stochastic processes. For this purpose, differing from the rest of the relevant empirical literature, after specifying the long run equilibrium relations we estimate the linkages between the bond markets as subject to hidden Markov chains, by applying the Markov Switching Vector Error Correction framework (MS-VECM). This formulation is found to efficiently reflect the shifts brought about by significant economic events, such as the European monetary unification. As a result we illustrate different short-run relations referring to the periods before and after the monetary union. Overall, our empirical results indicate that stronger interactions among the markets of the system exist in the period after the EMU. Also, by means of a variance decomposition analysis we assess leader-follower relations which indicate that the benchmark status of bonds has changed since the introduction of the common monetary policy framework in Europe.;;;;;;;;;4;0;0;0;0;0;4;;;1354-7798;;;;;;;;;;;Athens Univ Econ & Business, Dept Accounting & Finance, GR-10434 Athens, GreeceBank Greece, Financial Operat Dept, GR-10250 Athens, Greece;;;;2012-06-13;WOS:000304188000004;;

We employed daily data on natural gas futures prices, crude oil futures prices, carbon futures prices, and Dow Jones energy commodity futures prices from January 2018 to October 2021. For empirical analysis, we applied machine learning tools including traditional multiple linear regression (MLR), artificial neural network (ANN), support vector regression (SVR), and long short-term memory (LSTM). The machine learning analysis provides two key findings. First, the nonlinear frameworks outperform linear models in developing the relationships between future oil prices (crude oil and heating oil) and carbon emission futures prices. Second, the machine learning findings establish that when oil prices and natural gas prices display extreme movement, carbon emission futures prices react nonlinearly. Understanding the nonlinear dynamics of extreme movements can help policymakers design climate and environmental policies, as well as adjust natural gas and oil futures prices.

The literature predominantly resorts to a simple but suboptimal procedure that scales returns with predictive instruments and computes standard bounds using the original and scaled returns. This article provides a formal bridge between the two approaches. We propose an optimally scaled bound that coincides with the GHT bound when the first and second conditional moments are known. When these moments are misspecified, our optimally scaled bound yields a valid lower bound for the standard deviation of pricing kernels, whereas the GHT bound does not. We illustrate the behavior of the bounds using a number of linear and nonlinear models for consumption growth and bond and stock returns. We also illustrate how the optimally scaled bound can be used as a diagnostic for the specification of the first two conditional moments of asset returns.;;;;;;;;;36;0;0;0;0;0;52;;;0893-9454;1465-7368;;;;;;;;;;Columbia Univ, Sch Business, New York, NY 10027 USANBER, New York, NY USAUniv Calif Los Angeles, Los Angeles, CA USA;;;;2004-06-01;WOS:000220631900002;;

However, access to stable and affordable finance varies dramatically across countries. Models used to evaluate the energy transition do not differentiate regional financing costs and therefore cannot study risk-sharing mechanisms for renewable electricity generation. In this study, we incorporated the empirically estimated cost of capital differentiated by country and technology into an ensemble of five climate-energy-economy models. We quantified the additional financing cost of decarbonization borne by developing regions and explored policies of risk premium convergence across countries. We found that alleviating financial constraints benefits both climate and equity as a result of more renewable and affordable energy in the developing world. This highlights the importance of fair finance for energy availability, affordability and sustainability, as well as the need to include financial considerations in model-based assessments.Fair finance in the energy sector is modelled in five climate-energy-economy models.

Stock prices are a leading economic indicator of the United States of America's (U.S.A. 's) economy. An economic variable that influences stock market prices is interest rates through an inverse relationship. The changes in stock prices (or stock returns) are generally caused by the demand for stocks. This paper reports on a study that investigates the underlying spectral and time-frequency characteristics of daily Standard and Poor's (S&P) 500, Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA), and National Association of Securities Dealers Automated Quotations (NASDAQ) composite stock returns, and changes in interest rate (namely, inverted 3-month Treasury bill). The study thereafter compared these findings with those obtained in a previous study by Joseph et al, which focused on monthly stock returns and interest rate data. Subsequent to studying stock returns and changes in interest rate that showed relatively similar spectral and frequency-time characteristics, this study investigated the forecastability of stock returns (in S&P 500, DJIA, and NASDAQ composite) by inverted interest rate (in 3-month Treasury bills) over prediction horizons of five and 30 days with the forecasting period covering the last 13 years. The measures of forecast accuracy used were root mean square error and correlation. The forecasts were favorable in all cases even with simpler neural network models. (c) 2017 The Authors.

We propose and implement a model in which the spot price of power is a function of two state variables: demand (load) and fuel price. in this model, any power derivative price must satisfy a PDE with boundary conditions that reflect capacity limits and the non-linear relation between load and the spot price of power. Moreover, since power is non-storable and demand is not a traded asset, the power derivative price embeds a market price of risk. Using inverse problem techniques and power forward prices from the PJM market, we solve for this market price of risk function. During 1999-2001, the upward bias in the forward price was as large as $50/MWh for some days in July. By 2005, the largest estimated upward bias had fallen to $19/MWh. These large biases are plausibly due to the extreme right skewness of power prices: this induces left skewness in the payoff to short forward positions, and a large risk premium is required to induce traders to sell power forwards. This risk premium suggests that the power market is not fully integrated with the broader financial markets.

With the test applied to over 250 years of monthly data for the UK covering the period 1753:08 to 2017:02, we find that pattern changes and the interaction of pattern changes with the term-spread, besides the term spread itself, tends to also play an important role in predicting volatility at the upper end of its conditional distribution. In addition, the effect on excess returns from term spread, pattern changes and the interaction is found to have improved markedly over time, barring at the conditional median of the equity premium. Finally, comparisons are made with historical data of the US and South Africa, and implications of our results are discussed.;;;;;;;;;1;0;0;0;0;0;1;;;1062-9408;1879-0860;;;;;;;;;;Univ Pretoria, Pretoria, South AfricaHelmut Schmidt Univ, Hamburg, GermanyUniv Nebraska, Omaha, NE 68182 USALoughborough Univ, Henderson, NV 89012 USA;Loughborough Univ;;;2019-02-15;WOS:000457665700026;;

Hyperparameters are estimated to minimize mispricing across government bonds with different maturities. The Group Lasso algorithm outperforms the other models studied, followed by Lasso. In addition, the majority of the models outperform the Random Walk benchmark. The feature importance analysis reveals that oil prices, bond-related factors, labor market conditions, banks' balance sheets, and manufacturing-related factors significantly drive yield curve predictions. This study is one of the few that uses such a broad array of macroeconomic variables to examine Canadian macro-level outcomes.

This paper attempts to strengthen this argument by concentrating attention on global wealth concentration.

Specifically, we model the distribution of the yield curve factors according to an infinite Markov mixture (iMM). The model allows for time variation in the mean and covariance matrix of factors in a discrete manner, as opposed to continuous changes in these parameters such as the Time Varying Parameter (TVP) models. Estimating the number of regimes using the iMM structure endogenously leads to an adaptive process that can generate newly emerging regimes over time in response to changing economic conditions in addition to existing regimes. The potential of the proposed framework is examined using US bond yields data. The semiparametric structure of the factors can handle various forms of non-normalities including fat tails and nonlinear dependence between factors using a unified approach by generating new clusters capturing these specific characteristics. We document that modeling parameter changes in a discrete manner increases the model fit as well as forecasting performance at both short and long horizons relative to models with fixed parameters as well as the TVP model with continuous parameter changes. This is mainly due to fact that the discrete changes in parameters suit the typical low frequency monthly bond yields data characteristics better.;;;;;;;;;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;;;0747-4938;1532-4168;;;;;;;;;;Koc Univ, Dept Econ, Rumelifeneri Yolu, TR-34450 Istanbul, Turkey;;;;2019-12-06;WOS:000498499200001;;

Given its forward-looking nature, implied volatility might be more valuable than backward-looking measures of realized price fluctuations. Conversely, the volatility risk premium embedded in implied volatility leads to overestimating the observed price variation. This paper explores the benefits of augmenting econometric models used in forecasting the expected shortfall, a risk measured endorsed in the Basel III Accord, with information on implied volatility obtained from EUR/USD option contracts. The day-ahead forecasts are obtained from several classes of econometric models: historical simulation, EGARCH, quantile regression-based HAR, joint VaR and ES model, and combination forecasts. We verify whether the resulting expected shortfall forecasts are well-specified and test the models' accuracy. Our results provide evidence that the information provided by forward-looking implied volatility is more valuable than that in backward-looking realized measures. These results hold across multiple model specifications, are stable over time, hold under alternative loss functions, and are more pronounced during periods of higher market uncertainty when risk modeling matters most.

For FHLB, FNMA, and SLMA bonds, call value estimates range from 1.23% of par to 1.47% on average, which are between those for the treasury and corporate debt securities. FHLMC bonds, on the other hand, have an average call value estimate of 2.85%. Call values are significantly larger for bonds with a longer remaining maturity and greater default risk. Most interestingly, call values in the call protection period are significantly larger than those in the callable period except for the SLMA bonds, whereas previous studies on corporate debt find no significant difference in call values between these two periods.In general, call value exhibits a downward trend over time as the callable bond approaches maturity. Also, call value is inversely related to the level of interest rates. Interest rate drops are usually accompanied by an increase in Call values. An analysis of the determinants of call values suggests the following conclusions. First, call values are negatively related to short-term interest rates and the slope of the yield curve, and positively related to coupon rate and remaining maturity. Second, bonds with a greater amount of call protection have smaller call values, which is in contrast with the finding in a previous study on corporate debt that call protection period has little effect on call value.

Design/methodology/approach The authors specifies a vector error correction model (VECM) to the data. VECM are used to address the nonstationarity issues of financial variables while maintaining the information embedded in the levels of the data, as opposed to their differences. The cap rate series used are from Green Street Advisors and represent transaction cap rates which avoids the problem of artificial smoothness found in appraisal-based cap rates. Findings Using a VECM specified with the novel variable, unemployment and past cap rates contains enough information to produce more robust forecasts than the traditional variables (return expectations and risk premiums). The method is robust both in and out of sample. Practical implications This has direct implications for governmental policy, offering a path to real estate price stability and growth through mortgage access-functions largely influenced by the Fed and the quasi-federal agencies Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. It also offers a timely alternative to interest rate-based forecasting models, which are likely to be less useful as interest rates are to be held low for the foreseeable future. Originality/value This study offers a new and highly explanatory variable to the literature while being among the only to model either (1) transactional cap rates (versus appraisal) (2) out-of-sample data (versus in-sample) (3) without the use of the traditional variables thought to be integral to cap rate modelling (return expectations and risk premiums).;;;;;;;;;8;0;0;0;0;0;10;;;1463-578X;1470-2002;;;;;;;;;;FCP, Washington, DC 20223 USALinneman Associates, Philadelphia, PA USA;FCPLinneman Associates;;;2021-08-15;WOS:000682207600001;;

After identifying the main determinants of the long-run target (strategy), we focus on which interest rate conditions allow for a temporary deviation (tactics). The study is partly motivated by the apparent window of opportunity to issue more heavily at longer maturities given the recent historically low yields. We show that the room for long tactical positions on the long-term bond is actually narrower than predicted by rules of thumb based on Sharpe-like ratios. Once the model is augmented to embed real world features such as no price-taking and transaction costs, the scope for tactical position shrinks further. We discuss the model results and its implications in terms of the principal agent dilemma (government vs. debt manager); the paper also explores the financial stability implications arising from public debt issuance choices. All in all, our findings provide a rationale for the degree of caution often shown by many public debt managers in fulfilling their mandate. (C) 2015 Society for Policy Modeling.

Thus, we use nonlinear autoregressive distributed lags (NARDL) analysis to capture nonlinear relations between the volatility and the sovereign credit risks of these countries by using daily data from 04.01.2010 to 29.11.2019. The bounds test of the NARDL model confirms the cointegration between VIX and CDS spreads of the countries under study. The analysis of estimated NARDL parameters shows that negative shocks of the volatility index have a long-lasting impact on CDS spreads. Chinese CDS spread are more sensitive to VIX index changes in the short run. The effect of a decrease in volatility on Russian CDS spread is higher than the effect of an increase. Turkish and Brazilian CDS spreads are more reactive to increase in the VIX, whereas Mexican CDS is less sensitive. These findings show that investors, arbitrageurs and speculators should consider global indicators when taking a position on sovereign bonds of emerging markets.;;;;;;;;;2;1;0;0;0;0;4;;;1303-099X;;;;;;;;;;;Istanbul Medeniyet Univ, Finance, Istanbul, TurkeyADA Univ, Finance, Sch Business, Baku, Azerbaijan;;;;2022-02-10;WOS:000748750900001;;

Recent studies have investigated the relation between public sentiment and stock price movements and demonstrated that investment decisions are affected by public opinion. In this paper, we design a novel framework that combines the wisdom of crowds and technical analysis for financial market prediction using a new fusion strategy. A machine learning technique called deep random subspace ensembles (DRSE), which integrates deep learning algorithms and ensemble learning methods, is proposed according to the characteristics of the prediction task. Based on collected real-world datasets, the experimental results show that our proposed method outperforms the baseline models in predicting stock market by at least 14.2% in terms of AUC value, indicating the efficacy of DRSE as a viable mechanism for financial market prediction.

We find that the positive short-term return predictability of OTM-based MFIS significantly reverses if ITM-options are used instead. While this reversal is inconsistent with an explanation based on skewness preferences, MFIS apparently reflects information that is not timely incorporated in stock prices due to market frictions. Based on these insights, we introduce Delta MFIS as a new measure of additional option-embedded information that significantly predicts subsequent returns beyond a large range of other option-based return predictors.

Grain products and feed grain contaminated with deoxynivalenol (DON) (commonly known as vomitoxin) are subject to Food and Drug Administration advisory limits and as a result end-users place restrictions on their use. This has led to steep price discounts, as well as higher risks for producers and grain merchandisers. Varietal research has led to development of varieties that are resistant or moderately resistant to FHB. Studies indicate combinations of genetic resistance, fungicides and some management practices (combine settings, tillage practices, etc.) can be used to decrease economic costs due to FHB. The purpose of this study was to estimate the economic costs of scab. To do so we developed several economic models, analysed extensive data and conducted surveys of wheat flour millers, barley maltsters, and grain handlers. A detailed assessment of costs indicates the most important costs accrued by the wheat and barley industries were the risk premium paid to induce adoption of DON reducing technologies and the value of yield forgone. These were followed by the direct costs of fungicide, added shipping costs, testing and segregation and discounts.;;;;;;;;;75;0;0;0;56;0;87;;;1875-0710;1875-0796;;;;;;;;;;North Dakota State Univ, Dept Agribusiness & Appl Econ, NDSU Dept 7610,POB 6050, Fargo, ND 58108 USA;;;;2018-12-28;WOS:000430885100011;;

The two regimes, a high-spread and a low-spread regime, are distinguished by using a threshold, in accordance with the perceived fair value of the spread as a reference point. Our results suggest that government-bond spreads are regime-dependent, as most of the regression coefficients of the determinants of the spread are larger (in absolute value) in the high-spread regime than in the low-spread regime. That is, an improvement in the macroeconomic environment (e.g., lower unemployment, lower inflation, lower growth of the debt-to-GDP ratio, less macroeconomic uncertainty, higher growth of real GDP), and/or an improvement in the quality of institutions (e.g., less corruption) reduce the spread facing a country (by enhancing its creditworthiness) to a greater extent in high-spread situations than in low-spread situations. A possible explanation is that the demand for and the supply of loans are inelastic at higher than fair interest rates and elastic at lower rates.;;;;;;;;;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;;;1081-1826;1558-3708;;;;;;;;;;Univ Ioannina, Dept Econ, Univ Campus, GR-45110 Ioannina, GreeceHellen Open Univ, 18 Aristotelous, Patras 26335, GreeceEikos Co Consulting Firm, Napoleon Zerva 28-30, Ioannina 45332, Greece;Eikos Co Consulting Firm;;;2022-06-18;WOS:000807623600001;;

The reason is that financial time series are complex, non stationary. Furthermore, it is also very difficult to predict this movement with parametric models. Instead of parametric models, we propose two techniques, which are data driven and non parametric. Based on the idea that excess returns would be possible with publicly available information, we developed two models in order to forecast the short term price movements by using technical indicators. Our assumption is that the future value of a stock price depends on the financial indicators although there is no parametric model to explain this relationship. This relationship comes from the technical analysis. Comparison shows that support vector regression (SVR) out performs the multi layer perceptron (MLP) networks for a short term prediction in terms of the mean square error. If the risk premium is used as a comparison criterion, then the SVR technique is as good as the MLP method or better.;;;;;;;;;64;1;0;0;2;0;71;;;0308-1079;1563-5104;;;;;;;;;;Univ Oklahoma, Sch Ind Engn, Norman, OK 73019 USAGebze Inst Technol, Fac Business Adm, Kocaeli, Turkey;;;;2008-01-01;WOS:000260609900002;;

In addition, the interest rate is used by the governments to manage the monetary policy. There is a need to design an efficient algorithm for interest rate prediction. The analysis of the social media sentiment impact on financial decision making is also an open research area. In this study, we deploy a deep learning model for the accurate forecasting of the interest rate for the UK, Turkey, China, Hong Kong, and Mexico. For this purpose, daily data of the interest rate and exchange rate covering the period from Jan 2010 to Oct 2019 is used for all the mentioned countries. We also incorporate the input of the twitter sentiments of six mega-events, namely the US election 2012, Mexican election 2012, Gaza under attack 2014, Hong Kong protest 2014, Refugee Welcome 2015, and Brexit 2016. Our results provide evidence that the error of the deep learning model significantly decreases when event sentiment is incorporated. A notable improvement has been observed in the case of the Hong Kong interest rate, i.e., a 266% decline in the error after incorporating event sentiments as an input in the deep learning model.;;;;;;;;;9;0;0;0;0;0;11;;;;2071-1050;;;;;;;;;;COMSATS Univ Islamabad, Dept Management Sci, Attock Campus, Attock 43600, PakistanCOMSATS Univ Islamabad, Dept Comp Sci, Attock Campus, Attock 43600, PakistanGovt Coll Univ, Dept Commerce, Faisalabad 38000, PakistanUniv Kotli AJ&K, Dept Business Adm, Kotli 11100, PakistanUniv Wah, Dept Management Sci, Wah Cantt 47040, PakistanSejong Univ, Dept Software, Seoul 05006, South Korea;Univ Kotli AJ&KUniv Wah;;;2020-04-14;WOS:000522460200378;;

Multivariate statistical and stochastic process-based sovereign default risk forecasting has a 50-year developmental history. This article describes a continuous, non-homogeneous Markov chain method as the basis for a COVID-19-related sovereign default risk forecast model. It demonstrates the estimation of sovereign probabilities of default (PDs) over a five-year horizon period with the developed model reflecting the impact of the COVID-19 crisis. The COVID-19-adopted Markov model estimates PDs for most countries, including those that are advanced with AAA and AA ratings, to suggest that no sovereign nation's economy is secure from the financial impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. The dynamics of the estimated PDs are indicative of contemporary evidence as experienced in the recent financial crisis. The empirical results of this article have policy implications for foreign investors, sovereign lenders, export finance institutions, foreign trade experts, risk management professionals, and policymakers in the field of finance. The developed model can be used to timely recognize potential problems with sovereign entities in the current COVID-19 crisis and to take appropriate mitigating actions.;;;;;;;;;6;0;0;0;1;0;6;;;1911-8066;1911-8074;;;;;;;;;;Corvinus Univ Budapest, Inst Dev Enterprises, H-1093 Budapest, Hungary;;;;2021-12-11;WOS:000726874600001;;

It provides relevant information for pricing deterministic financial cash flows, it measures economic market expectations and it is extremely useful when assessing the effectiveness of monetary policy decisions. However, it is not directly observable and needs to be estimated by smoothing asset pricing data through statistical techniques. The most popular techniques adjust parsimonious functional forms based on bond yields to maturity. Unfortunately, these functions, which need to be optimised, are highly non-linear which make them very sensitive to the initial conditions. In this context, this paper proposes the use of genetic algorithms to find the values for the initial conditions and to reduce the risk of false convergence, showing that stable parameters are obtained without imposing arbitrary restrictions.

Forecasting the daily demand can improve the local service provider's access to information and help them manage their short-term supply more effectively. This study developed the forecasting model using real-time data and weather information from Jeju Island, South Korea. Cluster analysis under the rental pattern of the electric kickboard is a component of the forecasting processes. We cannot achieve noticeable results at first because of the low amount of training data. We require a lot of data to produce a solid prediction result. For the sake of the subsequent experimental procedure, we created synthetic time-series data using a generative adversarial networks (GAN) approach and combined the synthetic data with the original data. The outcomes have shown how the GAN-based synthetic data generation approach has the potential to enhance prediction accuracy. We employ an ensemble model to improve prediction results that cannot be achieved using a single regressor model. It is a weighted combination of several base regression models to one meta-regressor. To anticipate the daily demand in this study, we create an ensemble model by merging three separate base machine learning algorithms, namely CatBoost, Random Forest (RF), and Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost). The effectiveness of the suggested strategies was assessed using some evaluation indicators. The forecasting outcomes demonstrate that mixing synthetic data with original data improves the robustness of daily demand forecasting and outperforms other models by generating more agreeable values for suggested assessment measures. The outcomes further show that applying ensemble techniques can reasonably increase the forecasting model's accuracy for daily electric kickboard demand.;;;;;;;;;15;0;0;0;0;0;16;;;;1424-8220;;;;;;;;;;Jeju Natl Univ, Dept Comp Engn, Jeju 63243, South KoreaJeju Natl Univ, Inst Informat Sci & Technol, Dept Comp Engn, Major Elect Engn, Jeju 63243, South Korea;;;;2023-02-12;WOS:000918377800001;36679392;

The purpose of this paper is to develop an evolving fuzzy-GARCH modeling approach for stock market asset returns forecasting. The method addresses GARCH volatility modeling within the framwork of evolving fuzzy systems. This hybrid methodology aims to account for time-varying volatility, from GARCH approach, as well as volatility clustering and nonlinear time series identification, from evolving fuzzy systems, which use time-varying data streams to continuously and simultaneously adapt the structure and functionality of fuzzy models. The motivation is to improve model performance as new data is input through gradual model construction, inducing model adaptation and refinement without catastrophic forgetting while keeping current model useful.

In this paper, we propose the Merton-LSTM model, a modified LSTM model formed by integrating with the Merton determinants model, to forecast the CDS indices. We provide the rigorous math behind the Merton-LSTM model, which demonstrates that by leveraging the nonlinear learning ability of LSTM with increased model capacity, the Merton-LSTM model is expected to learn the inherent association between the Merton determinants and CDS spreads. Further, the Merton-LSTM model is compared with the machine learning models LSTM, gated recurrent unit (GRU), multilayer perceptron network (MLP), support vector machine (SVM) and a typical sto-chastic series model in forecasting the two most liquid five-year CDS indices, North America High Yield index (CDX.NA.HY) and North America Investment Grade index (CDX.NA.IG) through the root mean squared error (RMSE) and the Diebold-Mariano test. The comparison results show that the RMSEs of the Merton-LSTM model are the lowest (6.2570-27.2000 for CDX.NA.HY and 1.3168-6.4772 for CDX.NA.IG) compared to other competitive models. The superiority of the Merton-LSTM model in forecasting performance is highlighted in long-term prediction even with a forecasting horizon extended to 28 days. Simulated trading with different thresholds and horizons is conducted in this study. We find that the Merton-LSTM trading strategy yields the highest annualized Sharpe ratios and lowest maximum losses at most thresholds and horizons, highlighting the economic significance of the proposed model.;;;;;;;;;15;2;0;0;1;0;18;;;0957-4174;1873-6793;;;;;;;;;;Hunan Univ, Coll Business Adm, Changsha 410082, Peoples R ChinaGeorge Washington Univ, Sch Engn & Appl Sci, Washington, DC 20052 USAHunan Univ, Coll Comp Sci & Elect Engn, Changsha 410082, Peoples R China;;;;2022-11-13;WOS:000877842700010;;

Among these, Kiyotaki et al. (2012) is a prominent example. In this paper, we investigate whether the liquidity shocks and financial frictions proposed by Kiyotaki et al. (2012) can improve the asset pricing predictions of the frictionless RBC model. We study the quantitative business cycle and asset pricing properties in an economy in which agents feature recursive preferences, are subject to a liquidity constraint, and suffer liquidity shocks. We find that the model predicts highly nonlinear time variation and levels of risk premia, which are driven by endogenous fluctuations in equity prices. However, the model fails to account for a basic fact: Periods of scarce liquidity are associated with high asset prices and low expected returns. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Falling hedging demand helps explain this behavior, as premiums and trader exposures tend to fall together when risk rises.

Under the risk-neutral measure, the distribution of the state vector X(t) resides within a family of discrete-time affine processes that nests the exact discrete-time counterparts of the entire class of continuous-time models in Duffie and Kan (1996) and Dai and Singleton (2000). Under the historical distribution, our approach accommodates nonlinear (nonaffine) processes while leading to closed-form expressions for the conditional likelihood functions for zero-coupon bond yields. As motivation for our framework, we show that it encompasses many of the equilibrium models with habit-based preferences or recursive preferences and long-run risks. We illustrate our methods by constructing maximum likelihood estimates of a nonlinear discrete-time DTSM with habit-based preferences in which bond prices are known in closed form. We conclude that habit-based models, as typically parameterized in the literature, do not match key features of the conditional distribution of bond yields.;;;;;;;;;58;0;0;0;0;0;87;;;0893-9454;;;;;;;;;;;Univ N Carolina, Dept Finance, Kenan Flagler Business Sch, Chapel Hill, NC 27515 USAStanford Univ, Grad Sch Business, Stanford, CA 94305 USA;;;;2010-05-01;WOS:000276745800011;;

We examine this relationship with a focus on two key channels of cross-border flows, namely external debt securities (EDS) and cross-border loans (CBLs). Our analysis focuses on the transition in cross-border flows post-global financial crisis 2008 (GFC) termed as the second phase of global liquidity (Shin in Keynote address at Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco Asia economic policy conference, 2013). Panel vector autoregression estimations show that volatility in global risk perception affects cross-border flows to EMEs more as compared to the effect of the US monetary policy stance. Post-GFC, EDS flows rise with shocks in global risk perception, while CBL flows register a decline. CBL flows are also associated with larger risks post-GFC compared to the pre-GFC period, which is in contrast to the result for EDS flows. Second, a panel threshold estimation confirms a nonlinear association between EDS/CBL flows and macroeconomic risks largely dependent upon global uncertainty. US GDP growth also affects the nonlinearity, but US federal funds rate have insignificant threshold effects. Our results conclude that global uncertainty is a significant driver of cross-border flows to EMEs post-GFC and that it is a strong signal in determining riskiness of EDS flows and CBL flows for EMEs.;;;;;;;;;5;0;0;0;0;0;9;;;0377-7332;1435-8921;;;;;;;;;;IGIDR, Mumbai, Maharashtra, India;IGIDR;;;2021-08-08;WOS:000679277400001;;

The results reveal a pronounced asymmetry: physical climate risk significantly and negatively predicts stock returns both in-sample and out-of-sample, whereas transition climate risk demonstrates insignificant forecasting ability. This superior performance of physical risk delivers greater economic gains to investors and remains robust even after controlling for widely used economic predictors. However, its predictability is state-dependent, weakening during economic disruptions and strengthening following the COP21 Agreement. Further analysis shows that the cash flow and sentiment channels potentially drive the strong predictability of physical risk. Overall, our findings underscore the importance of incorporating physical climate risk into equity return forecasting models, offering actionable insights for financial decision-making processes.;;;;;;;;;1;0;0;0;0;0;1;;;1057-5219;1873-8079;;;;;;;;;;Hunan Univ, Coll Finance & Stat, Changsha 410079, Peoples R China;;;;2025-06-26;WOS:001509663300001;;

Extensive descriptive data analysis shows that both time series feature heavy tails and conditional heteroscedasticity and show asymmetric behavior in their differences. We propose state-space time series models under skewed, heavy-tailed distributions to capture all stylized facts of the data. They include the impact of autocorrelation, seasonality, risk premia, temperature, storage levels, the price of European Emission Allowances, and related fuel prices of oil, coal, and electricity. We provide rigorous model diagnostics and interpret all model components in detail.

Using a large dataset of US mid-cap companies observed over 30 years, we look to predict the default probability term structure over the short to medium term and understand which data sources (i.e. fundamental, market or pricing data) contribute most to the default risk. Whereas existing methods typically require that data from different time periods are first aggregated and turned into crosssectional features, we frame the problem as a multi-label panel data classification problem. To tackle it, we then employ transformer models, a state-of-the-art deep learning model emanating from the natural language processing domain. To make this approach suitable to the given credit risk setting, we use a loss function for multi-label classification, to deal with the term structure, and propose a multi-channel architecture with differential training that allows the model to use all input data efficiently. Our results show that the proposed deep learning architecture produces superior performance, resulting in a sizeable improvement in AUC (Area Under the receiver operating characteristic Curve) over traditional models. In order to interpret the model, we also demonstrate how to produce an importance ranking for the different data sources and their temporal relationships, using a Shapley approach for feature groups.(c) 2022 The Author(s).

Political short-termism, policy myopia, policy short-sightedness, and similar words have been coined to emphasize the present-centric policy thinking. Politics tends to produce short time horizons, and as a result, policymakers often fail to use present opportunities to mitigate future harms. Focusing on fiscal and monetary strategic interactions, given different separate decision makers, our paper aims to explore the effects of policymakers' time horizons on debt stabilization. To formalize our ideas, we use the novel concept of Nonlinear-model-predictive-control Feedback Nash Equilibrium (NFNE) and find that present-centric policy thinking and decision horizons matters under several dimensions.;;;;;;;;;9;0;0;0;0;0;10;;;0048-5829;1573-7101;;;;;;;;;;Sapienza Univ Roma, Fac Econ, Dipartimento Economa & Diritto, Via Castro Laurenziano 9, I-00161 Rome, ItalyAlbert & Vera List Acad Ctr, New Sch, Int Cooperat & Dev, New York, NY USA;Albert & Vera List Acad Ctr;;;2018-10-25;WOS:000446708000006;;

Compared to property price determinants, the capitalisation rate has received significantly less attention. This is somewhat surprising given that the capitalisation rate is a more insightful indicator for investors on commercial property market performance than merely price changes or trends. The capitalisation rate, measured as the ratio of net operating income to the property's capital value, captures the asset's overall ability to generate income which is crucial for investors who typically invest in property for their income-generating capacity. The purpose of this paper is to address these issues.Design/methodology/approachTo evaluate the determinants of capitalisation rates, time series analysis was used. The data capture performance in the Australian commercial property market between 2005 and 2018. All macroeconomic and financial data are freely available from official sources such as the Australian Bureau of Statistics and the nation's central bank. Methodology wise, given the problematic nature of the data such as a mixed order of integration and the possibility of cointegration amongst some of the I (1) variables, the autoregressive distributed lag model was selected given its flexibility and relative lack of assumptions.FindingsBond rates, market risk premiums, stock market excess returns and other macroeconomic variables were found to drive capitalisation rates of Australian commercial properties. A 1% increase in the bond rate results in approximately 0.3-2.4% increase in capitalisation rates depending on the sub-market. Further, a 1% increase in excess market returns results in a 0.01-0.02% increase in capitalisation rates. Regarding risk premiums, a 100 basis point increase in the BBB spread results in approximately 0.92-1.27% reduction in cap rates in certain markets.Practical implicationsAsset managers will find these results useful in asset allocation strategies. Commercial properties offer attractive investment qualities such as yield stability in periods of economic uncertainty while allowing for the possibility of capital growth through appreciation of the underlying asset. By understanding the factors that affect the capitalisation rate, practitioners may predict emerging trends and identify threats to portfolio return and stability. This allows better integration of commercial property in the construction of portfolios that remain robust in a variety of market conditions.Originality/valueThe contribution to literature is significant given the lack of similar studies in the Australian market. The performance of real estate assets using cap rates as a comparative measure to equities and bonds influences decisions in asset allocation strategies. It provides crucial information for investors to estimate the performance of commercial property. This research supports the notion that both space and capital market indicators jointly affect capitalisation rates. The findings expand the knowledge base relating to commercial properties and validate the assessments of investors, developers and valuers who utilise yield as a performance benchmark for asset allocation strategies.;;;;;;;;;2;0;0;0;0;0;4;;;1463-578X;1470-2002;;;;;;;;;;RMIT Univ, Sch Property Construct & Project Management, Melbourne, Australia;;;;2023-02-12;WOS:000919136600001;;

Contrary to studies on other countries, our research identifies a positive correlation between the productivity of Chinese firms and their future stock returns. We suggest that this correlation is driven by mispricing rather than risk premium. Specifically, we argue that investors' difficulties in accurately assessing firm-level productivity and limited attention result in the inadequate incorporation of this information into stock prices. Furthermore, our analysis explores additional factors contributing to the observed productivity-related market anomaly, including investor overconfidence, positive feedback trading, lottery preference, information uncertainty, and limits to arbitrage, indicating investors' irrationality and behavioral biases. Importantly, our study also demonstrates that firm-level productivity serves as a reliable predictor of a firm's future profitability.;;;;;;;;;1;0;0;0;0;0;1;;;1059-0560;1873-8036;;;;;;;;;;Jiangnan Univ, Sch Business, Wuxi 214122, Jiangsu, Peoples R ChinaKean Univ, Coll Business & Publ Management, Union, NJ 07083 USA;;;;2024-09-21;WOS:001314328900001;;

More specifically, we propose a sequential autoencoder (SAE) to process the sequential data, extract and decode the low-dimensional representations and generate the milk yield sequences. The SAE is compared with a more traditional multilayer perceptron model (MLP) which uses herd and parity information and lagged milk yields as input. Results show that incorporating the recorded daily milk yields, lactation number, herd statistics as well as reproduction and health events the cow encountered during the lactation cycle results in the most qualitative latent representations. Moreover, by leveraging these low-dimensional encodings, the SAE reconstructed the entire milk yield curve with a higher accuracy than the MLP. Hence, we present a framework that is able to infer missing milk yields along the entire lactation curve which facilitates selection and culling decisions as well as the estimation of future earnings and costs. Furthermore, the model allows farmers to enhance their animal monitoring systems as it incorporates the sequence of health and reproduction events to forecast the cow's future productivity.;;;;;;;;;10;0;0;0;6;0;13;;;0168-1699;1872-7107;;;;;;;;;;Univ Ghent, Fac Econ & Business Adm, Tweekerkenstr 2, B-9000 Ghent, BelgiumUniv Ghent, Fac Vet Med, Salisburylaan 133, B-9820 Merelbeke, Belgium;;;;2020-08-06;WOS:000552020100074;;

The approach in this paper is motivated by some recent theoretical literature on the limits to speculation and hysteresis. The paper estimates Logistic Smooth Transition Dynamic Regression (LSTR) models with a variety of transition variables, including the lagged forward premium, monetary and income fundamentals and also variables associated with time varying risk premium, including the conditional variances of some fundamentals. Results are reported for nine different currencies. Many of the estimated LSTR models provide evidence for the existence of an outer regime that is consistent with UIP. Estimation of the standard forward premium regression on observations falling in these regimes across the sample is moderately supportive of UIP holding in the outer regime. A simulation experiment also suggests that an LSTR dgp can produce data consistent with the anomaly. However, parameter estimation issues leads to considerable uncertainty with the estimated transition functions and hence imprecise definitions of regimes. The results are an interesting step in the direction of understanding the nonlinear dimension of the problem without fully resolving the anomaly. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

In contrast, this study proposes a model to predict the entire lactation curve of dairy cows by leveraging historical milk yield information observed in the preceding cycle. More specifically, we present a deep learning framework to encode the model inputs, predict the latent representation of the milk yield sequences and generate the corresponding lactation curves. Results show that the proposed framework outperforms the baseline models and that during the first 26 days of lactation, the model's predictions are more accurate than those of a state-of-the-art lactation model which is able to leverage the observed milk yields. As a result, the framework presented in this study allows farmers to increase their forecast horizon with respect to predicting its herd's total production and hence facilitates optimal herd management. Additionally, the model can be used to compare a cow's actual and expected milk yield over the entire course of the lactation cycle. This in turn can help to accelerate disease detection and enhance current animal monitoring systems. Finally, as the model incorporates the impact of health and reproduction events as well as herd management on the cow's productivity, future earnings and costs can be estimated more accurately.;;;;;;;;;21;0;0;0;11;1;26;;;0168-1699;1872-7107;;;;;;;;;;Univ Ghent, Fac Econ & Business Adm, Tweekerkenstr 2, B-9000 Ghent, BelgiumUniv Ghent, Fac Vet Med, Salisburylaan133, B-9820 Merelbeke, Belgium;;;;2021-01-26;WOS:000605587300007;;

We use a unique dataset of media-driven ESG reputational risk indicators, covering 4963 Chinese firms from 2009 to 2023. On average, a one-standard-deviation increase in ESG reputational risks is associated with a 4.5 % decrease in simple stock returns, a 14.5 % reduction in excess stock returns relative to the market index, and a 12.2% decline in excess stock returns compared to peer firms of similar size. These negative effects contradict the traditional risk-return relationship predicted by risk premium theory. Further analysis identifies reduced investor confidence and tighter financing constraints as key mechanisms through which ESG reputational risks negatively affect stock returns. Heterogeneity analyses indicate that the negative impact is more pronounced for firms in non-pollution-intensive industries, those facing financing difficulties, and those exposed to environment-related reputational risks.;;;;;;;;;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;;;1044-0283;1873-5665;;;;;;;;;;Hohai Univ, Sch Econ & Finance, Changzhou, Jiangsu, Peoples R ChinaTsinghua Univ, Sch Humanities, Beijing, Peoples R China;;;;2025-06-06;WOS:001498959300001;;

Firstly, based on operational risk theory, market risk, research and development risk, financial risk, and human resource risk are selected as the primary indicators for enterprise risk assessment. Secondly, the Criteria Importance Through Intercriteria Correlation (CRITIC) weight method is employed to determine the importance of these risk indicators, thereby enhancing the model's prediction ability and stability. Following this, the FCM clustering algorithm is utilized for pre-processing sample data to improve the efficiency and accuracy of data classification. Finally, an improved RF model is constructed by optimizing the parameters of the RF algorithm. The data selected is mainly from RESSET/DB, covering the issuance, trading, and rating data of fixed-income products such as bonds, government bonds, and corporate bonds, and provides basic information, net value, position, and performance data of funds. The experimental results show that the model achieves an F1 score of 87.26%, an accuracy of 87.95%, an Area under the Curve (AUC) of 91.20%, a precision of 89.29%, and a recall of 87.48%. They are respectively 6.45%, 4.45%, 5.09%, 4.81%, and 3.83% higher than the traditional RF model.

While these techniques, such as Deep Belief Networks or Random Forests, are becoming more and more popular on the market, the academic literature is relatively sparse. Through a series of applications involving hundreds of variables/predictors and stocks, this article presents some of the state-of-the-art techniques and how they can be implemented to manage a long-short portfolio. Numerous practical and empirical issues are developed. One of the main questions beyond big data use is the value of information. Does an increase in the number of predictors improve the portfolio performance? Which features are the most important? A large number of predictors means, potentially, a high level of noise. How do the algorithms manage this? This article develops an application using a 22-year trading period, up to 300 U.S. large caps and around 600 predictors. The empirical results underline the ability of these techniques to generate useful trading signals for portfolios with important turnovers and short holding periods (one or five days). Positive excess returns are reported between 1993 and 2008. They are strongly reduced after accounting for transaction costs and traditional risk factors. When these machine learning tools were readily available in the market, excess returns turned into the negative in most recent times. Results also show that adding features is far from being a guarantee to boost the alpha of the portfolio. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Although the regimes captured by regime-switching models are identified by an econometric procedure, they often correspond to different periods in regulation, policy, and other secular changes. In empirical estimates, the means, volatilities, autocorrelations, and cross-covariances of asset returns often differ across regimes in a manner that allows regime-switching models to capture the stylized behavior of many financial series including fat tails, heteroskedasticity, skewness, and time-varying correlations. In equilibrium models, regimes in fundamental processes, such as consumption or dividend growth, strongly affect the dynamic properties of equilibrium asset prices and can induce non-linear risk-return trade-offs.

Furthermore, market shocks drive attention to financial websites, and heightened attention predicts an increase in the following trading day's volatility. Consistent with the information arrival hypothesis, the search for information is higher on Mondays and Tuesdays and lower on weekends. As some retail investors are noise traders, attention to financial websites has a positive effect on volatility and increases trading volume.

In the first case, we apply the non-linear least squares method to cross sectional data (i.e., all rates of a single day). In the second case, we consider the short rate obtained by means of the first procedure as a proxy or the real market short rate. Starting from this new proxy, we evaluate the parameters of the CIR model by means of martingale estimation techniques. The estimate of the market price of risk is provided by comparing results obtained with these two techniques, since this approach makes possible to isolate the market price of risk and evaluate, under the Local Expectations Hypothesis, the risk premium given by the market for different maturities. As a test case, we apply the method to data of the European Fixed Income Market. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V.

I propose a framework suggesting that the two are actually related and, specifically, that procyclical overoptimism can arise rationally from risk -taking incentives. I show that when firms and banks have a limited liability payoff structure, they have lower incentives to pay attention to the aggregate conditions that generate risk. This leads to systematic underestimation of the accumulation of risk during economic booms and overoptimistic beliefs. As a result, agents lend and borrow excessively, further increasing downside risk. Credit cycles driven by this new uninformed risk-taking are consistent with existing evidence such as high credit and low -risk premia predicting a higher probability of crises and negative returns for banks. My model suggests that regulating incentives can decrease overoptimistic beliefs and thus mitigate boom-and -bust cycles.;;;;;;;;;1;0;0;0;0;0;1;;;0304-3932;1873-1295;;;;;;;;;;Univ Lausanne, Quartier Chambronne, CH-1007 Lausanne, SwitzerlandUniv Lausanne, Dept Finance, HEC Lausanne, CH-1015 Lausanne, Switzerland;;;;2024-06-22;WOS:001242475100001;;

The indicators are implied options volatility, Treasury-Eurodollar (TED) spread and exchange rate. While implied volatility captures market risk in that it reflects the fear factor embedded in the price of an option, TED spread reflects the default risk premium that is priced into a key short-term credit instrument. Equity markets often show a tendency to reflect the incidence of these risk factors. And because they provide valuable information about the health of the economy, many have argued that equity market valuation be taken into account in the formulation of monetary policy. Results of this study not only show a statistically significant inverse relationship between the stock market and these risk factors, but also evidence of a cointegration. In a variance decomposition of the series, we find that equity valuation is a major contributor to the forecast error variances of each of the risk indicators, a finding that lends tacit support to the argument that risk indicators associated with the equity market be considered in monetary policy decisions.;;;;;;;;;3;0;0;0;0;0;3;;;0003-6846;1466-4283;;;;;;;;;;Purdue Univ Calumet, Hammond, IN 46321 USAVaal Univ Technol, Vanderbijl Pk, South AfricaKyung Hee Univ, Seoul, South Korea;;;;2012-04-04;WOS:000301542400011;;

The disposition effect and the attention effect seem to explain herding behavior at the stock level. At the individual investor level, the cumulative number of buys and portfolio values reduce the prediction of herding behavior, while high values of portfolio return lead to a small increase in herding. Individuals who herd do not outperform either market or non-herd portfolios, suggesting that herding is a behavioral bias. Thus, such behavior seems to destabilize stock markets, creating temporary discrepancies in stock prices followed by reversals back to funda-mentals. The most predictive factor in the performance tests of individual portfolios is the market risk premium and using equally-weighted factors rather than value-weighted factors seem to provide more consistent results in the portfolio performance analyses.;;;;;;;;;9;0;0;0;0;0;12;;;0275-5319;1878-3384;;;;;;;;;;Univ Gothenburg, Ctr Finance, Dept Business Adm, Box 610, S-40530 Gothenburg, Sweden;;;;2022-11-11;WOS:000874755600001;;

Weather index insurance can help to reduce the financial losses resulting from heat exposure. This paper introduces crop-specific payout functions based on restricted cubic splines in heat index insurance. The use of restricted cubic splines is a cutting-edge method to reflect empirically estimated temperature effects on crop yields and to estimate temperature-related yield losses. The integration of these temperature effects in payout functions facilitates insurance design and allows hourly temperatures to be used as the underlying index. An empirical analysis is used to assess heat stress effects for a panel of East German winter wheat and winter rapeseed producers, to calibrate insurance contracts accordingly and simulate the resulting risk reducing capacities. We find that the insurance scheme introduced here leads to statistically and economically significant out-of-sample risk reducing capacities for farmers, i.e. risk premiums are reduced by up to approximately 20% at the median, in comparison to the uninsured status and at the actuarially fair premium. Moreover, we highlight that policy-makers can support the cost-efficient provision of market-based weather index insurance by fostering data collection and data;;;;;;;;;29;3;0;0;6;0;39;;;0306-9192;1873-5657;;;;;;;;;;Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Agr Econ & Policy Grp, Zurich, SwitzerlandWageningen Univ, Business Econ Grp, Wageningen, Netherlands;;;;2022-02-06;WOS:000747979000003;;

The study aims to assess and quantify the potential influence of climate change and risk-related factors on the performance and dynamics of financial markets. In this paper, concern is defined as the attention paid to the risk of climate change and the associated negative consequences. The findings demonstrate that the aggregate index exhibits robust predictability of market risk premiums, both within the sample and out-of-sample. By comparison, the index contains additional information beyond 14 economic predictors and 12 risk/uncertainty indexes in forecasting stock market return. In addition, the index proves valuable for mean-variance investors in asset allocation, leading to significant economic gains. The study identifies the index's ability to capture the reversal of temporary price crashes caused by overreactions to climate change risk. Furthermore, it exhibits stronger return forecasting capability for green stocks, non-state-owned enterprise (non-SOE) stocks, and stocks in regions with low air pollution. Particularly during periods of low air pollution and relaxed regulation, the index displays an enhanced ability to forecast returns. The study's findings provide valuable insights for policymakers and financial institutions as they address 21st-century environmental challenges. Moreover, these findings can inform the design of adaptive measures and interventions aimed at mitigating ecological risks and promoting sustainable economic growth.;;;;;;;;;50;0;0;0;2;0;50;;;0272-4332;1539-6924;;;;;;;;;;Southwest Jiaotong Univ, Sch Econ & Management, Chengdu, Sichuan, Peoples R ChinaCardiff Univ, Cardiff Business Sch, Cardiff, WalesLUISS Univ, LUISS Business Sch, Rome, ItalySouthwest Jiaotong Univ, Sch Econ & Management, Chengdu 610031, Peoples R China;;;;2024-01-11;WOS:001133804800001;38159933;

However, the model's effectiveness is highly dependent on the quality of its inputs and is often challenged by subjective or biased views. Recent advancements in deep learning have enabled the generation of more objective, data-driven views, significantly enhancing the model's accuracy and reliability. In this study, we propose a novel CGL-BL Model, which employs a hybrid deep learning approach-CEEMDAN-GLSTM-LSTM (CGL)-to generate investor views. The CGL model leverages the CEEMDAN algorithm for return-based time series decomposition, a Genetic Algorithm-optimized LSTM network to enhance prediction accuracy, and an additional LSTM network for nonlinear aggregation of prediction results. The proposed CGL-BL model was evaluated on both the SSE 50 Index in China and the DJIA in the United States. Empirical results show that the proposed CGL-BL model outperforms all benchmark portfolios in terms of excess return, Sharpe ratio, and maximum drawdown when applied with a short-term rebalancing strategy on the SSE 50 Index and a medium-to-long-term strategy on the DJIA, demonstrating strong potential for practical application in financial markets.;;;;;;;;;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;;;0957-4174;1873-6793;;;;;;;;;;Univ Macau, Ave Univ, Taipa, Macau Sar, Peoples R China;;;;2025-07-25;WOS:001532059200001;;

A common strategy simplifies the task by limiting the analysis to just one option per date. We first discuss its drawbacks on the basis of model interpretation, estimation results and pricing exercises. We then turn the attention to a more flexible approach, that successfully exploits the wealth of information contained in large heterogeneous panels of options, and we apply it to actual S&P 500 index and index call options data. Our approach breaks the stochastic singularity between contemporaneous option prices by assuming that every observation is affected by measurement error, essentially recasting the problem as a non-linear filtering one. The resulting likelihood function is evaluated using a Monte Carlo Importance Sampling (MC-IS) strategy, combined with a Particle Filter algorithm. The results provide useful intuitions on the directions that should be followed to extend the model, in particular by allowing jumps or regime switching in the volatility process.;;;;;;;;;14;2;0;0;0;0;17;;;1368-4221;;;;;;;;;;;Univ Bologna, Dipartimento Sci Econ, I-40126 Bologna, Italy;;;;2012-12-26;WOS:000311707800002;;

Existing studies employ a broad range of assumptions and lack a consistent costing method. This study takes a more systematic approach to analyze plants with an amine-based postcombustion CCS system with 90% CO2 capture. We employ sensitivity analyses together with a probabilistic analysis to quantify costs for plants with and without CCS under uncertainty or variability in key parameters. Results for new baseload plants indicate a likely increase in levelized cost of electricity (LCOE) of $20-32/MWh (constant 2007$) or $22-40/MWh in current dollars. A risk premium for plants with CCS increases these ranges to $23-39/MWh and $25-46/MWh, respectively. Based on current cost estimates, our analysis further shows that a policy to encourage CCS at new NGCC plants via an emission tax or carbon price requires (at 95% confidence) a price of at least $125/t CO2 to ensure NGCC-CCS is cheaper than a plant without CCS. Higher costs are found for nonbaseload plants and CCS retrofits.;;;;;;;;;135;1;0;0;25;1;149;;;0013-936X;1520-5851;;;;;;;;;;Carnegie Mellon Univ, Dept Engn & Publ Policy, Pittsburgh, PA 15213 USA;;;;2012-03-20;WOS:000301630200007;22332665;

The numerical experiments indicated that the stochastic interest rate forecasts fluctuate in such low levels that may signal delayed investment entry in favour of higher expected yields.

These risk values are then interpreted as trading signals which are tested with automated trading strategies that buy undervalued and sell overvalued CMBS from November 2007 through June 2015. All three signals generate substantial positive trading profits in testing for the reduced form model but not for the structural generalization. The risk signals constructed independently of market pricing provide more profitable automated trading insights than those constructed from interactions between modeled risk measures and market spreads. In my tests of the information content of the risk signals with respect to future macroeconomic indicators, I find statistically significant evidence in keeping with recent studies. While I cannot reject CMBS efficiency, this paper's disclosure of new risk measures, the profitability of automated strategies based on those risk measures, and the statistical significance of their forward guidance capabilities, together contributes to our understanding of CMBS risk and the credit spread puzzle debate.

By emphasizing the use of two econometric approaches based on quantile regressions (standard quantile regression and Bayesian quantile regression with heteroskedasticity) we find that the propagation of shocks in euro's bond yield spreads shows almost no presence of shift-contagion in the sample periods considered (2003-2006, Nov. 2008-Nov. 2011, Dec. 2011-Apr. 2013). Shock transmission is no different on days with big spread changes and small changes. This is the case even though a significant number of the countries in our sample have been extremely affected by their sovereign debt and fiscal situations. The risk spillover among these countries is not affected by the size or sign of the shock, implying that so far contagion has remained subdued. However, the US crisis does generate a change in the intensity of the propagation of shocks in the eurozone between the 2003-2006 pre-crisis period and the Nov. 2008-Nov. 2011 post-Lehman one, but the coefficients actually go down, not up! All the increases in correlation we have witnessed over the last years come from larger shocks and the heteroskedasticity in the data, not from similar shocks propagated with higher intensity across Europe. These surprising, but robust, results emerge because this is the first paper, to our knowledge, in which a Bayesian quantile regression approach allowing for heteroskedasticity is used to measure contagion. This methodology is particularly well-suited to deal with nonlinear and unstable transmission mechanisms especially when asymmetric responses to sign and size are suspected. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Using seven major daily dollar exchange rates from January 1 1992 to December 31 1996, this paper finds evidence of significant time-varying correlations and the country-specific variances. Consistent with the finding of Alexius and Sellin (1997) (A latent factor model of European exchange rate risk premia.

National Treasury's intentions for fiscal consolidation have again drawn attention to the fiscal multiplier literature. Aim: The aim in the study is to calculate the size of fiscal expenditure multipliers over the period 2009 to 2019, taking into account the specific economic conditions and the funding choices of government. Setting: In the study fiscal policy is considered at a time when the debt to gross domestic product (GDP) ratio was rising rapidly. Methods: We use an econometric model to calculate the fiscal multipliers over the past decade. Our estimates take account of the specific fiscal conditions for each year, in particular the changing relationship between debt and the sovereign risk premia as well as the impact of tax increases. Results: The model suggests that the fiscal multiplier declined from 1.5 in 2010 to around zero in 2019 as the debt levels became progressively more unsustainable and large tax increases muted the aggregate demand effects from higher government expenditure. Conclusion: The low fiscal multipliers suggest that fiscal consolidation will be less costly in terms of growth forgone than generally perceived.;;;;;;;;;5;0;0;0;0;1;7;;;2222-3436;;;;;;;;;;;South African Reserve Bank, Pretoria, South Africa;South African Reserve Bank;;;2022-05-03;WOS:000786343600001;;

However, there is limited knowledge re-garding the consistency of market-wide co-movement proxies constructed based on these two perspectives. Employing Fama-French industry portfolios as samples, we construct market -wide co-movement proxies in terms of R2-based and network-based approaches. We further examine if and how market-wide co-movement is priced using supervised principal analysis (SPCA) proposed by Giglio et al. (2021). Our findings include: First, most topological properties are highly correlated with the R2-based proxies. Second, the risk-premium estimates by the SPCA range from 90 bps to 130 bps per month, depending on the size of the latent factors considered. Furthermore, most co-movement proxies are linked to the characteristics regarding asset fundamentals. However, the associated R2 values remain around only 15%, highlighting the challenges in hedging the risks associated with market-wide co-movement in equity markets.;;;;;;;;;3;0;0;0;0;0;3;;;0275-5319;1878-3384;;;;;;;;;;Nanjing Univ Informat Sci & Technol, Sch Management Sci & Engn, Nanjing 210044, Peoples R ChinaNanjing Univ Aeronaut & Astronaut, Coll Econ & Management, 29 Jiangjun Ave, Nanjing 211106, Peoples R China;;;;2023-10-08;WOS:001073970300001;;

The analysis uses matched quarterly inventory, UK Treasury bill interest rates, futures prices and cash prices for the commodity lead traded on the LME. The effects of cointegration on both linear and nonlinear Granger causality tests is also examined. When cointegration is not modelled, evidence is found of both linear and nonlinear causality between cash prices and analysed predictor variables. However, after controlling for cointegration, evidence of significant nonlinear causality is no longer found. These results contribute to the empirical literature on commodity price forecasting by highlighting the relationship between cointegration and detectable linear and nonlinear causality. The importance of interest rate and inventory as well as futures price in forecasting cash prices is also illustrated. Failure to detect significant nonlinearity after controlling for cointegration may also go some way to explaining the reason for the disappointing forecasting performances of many nonlinear models in the general finance literature. It may be that the variables are correct, but the functional form is overly complex and a standard VAR or VECM may often apply.;;;;;;;;;28;1;0;0;0;0;31;;;0003-6846;1466-4283;;;;;;;;;;Natl Chung Cheng Univ, Dept Finance, Chiayi 621, TaiwanMontana State Univ, Coll Business, Bozeman, MT 59717 USA;;;;2004-06-20;WOS:000222750100004;;

This approach goes beyond the usual practice of combining conditional mean forecasts from parametric time series models with only a few predictors. The hybrid methodology adopts the adaptive LASSO regularization to simultaneously reduce predictor dimension and obtain quantile forecasts. Several recent empirical studies have considered a large set of macroeconomic predictors and technical indicators with the goal of forecasting the S&P 500 equity risk premium. To illustrate the merit of the proposed approach, we extend the mean-based equity premium forecasting into the conditional quantile context. The application offers three main findings. First, combining parametric and non-parametric approaches adds quantile forecast accuracy over and above the constituent methods. Second, a handful of macroeconomic predictors are found to have systematic forecasting power. Third, different predictors are identified as important when considering lower, central and upper quantiles of the equity premium distribution.;;;;;;;;;1;0;0;0;0;0;1;;;2194-6507;1941-1928;;;;;;;;;;Univ Amsterdam, Amsterdam Sch Econ, NL-1018 WB Amsterdam, NetherlandsCalif State Univ Fullerton, Mihaylo Coll Business & Econ, Fullerton, CA 92634 USA;;;;2020-07-14;WOS:000544061900004;;

The analysis reveals that GLM does not provide a reliable parameter estimates for Multi-level factor (MLF) categorical predictors. Although GLM is widely used method to deter insurance premiums, improvements of GLM by using the data mining methods identified in this paper may solve practical challenges for the risk models.

The objective is to develop a new class of covariance regression factor models for covariance forecasting, along with a library of portfolio allocation tools that integrate with this new covariance forecasting framework. The novelty is in two stages: the type of covariance regression model and factor extractions used to construct the covariates used in the covariance regression, along with a powerful portfolio allocation framework for dynamic multi-period asset investment management. The major contributions of package CovRegpy can be found on the GitHub repository for this library in the scripts: CovRegpy.py, CovRegpy_DCC.py, CovRegpy_RPP.py, CovRegpy_SSA.py, CovRegpy_SSD.py, and CovRegpy_X11.py. These six scripts contain implementations of software features including multivariate covariance time series models based on the regularized covariance regression (RCR) framework, dynamic conditional correlation (DCC) framework, risk premia parity (RPP) weighting functions, singular spectrum analysis (SSA), singular spectrum decomposition (SSD), and X11 decomposition framework, respectively. These techniques can be used sequentially or independently with other techniques to extract implicit factors to use them as covariates in the RCR framework to forecast covariance and correlation structures and finally apply portfolio weighting strategies based on the portfolio risk measures based on forecasted covariance assumptions. Explicit financial factors can be used in the covariance regression framework, implicit factors can be used in the traditional explicit market factor setting, and RPP techniques with long/short equity weighting strategies can be used in traditional covariance assumption frameworks. We examine, herein, two real-world case studies for actuarial practitioners. The first of these is a modification (demonstrating the regularization of covariance regression) of the original example from Hoff & Niu ((2012). Statistica Sinica, 22(2), 729-753) which modeled the covariance and correlative relationship that exists between forced expiratory volume (FEV) and age and FEV and height. We examine this within the context of making probabilistic predictions about mortality rates in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. The second case study is a more complete example using this package wherein we present a funded and unfunded UK pension example. The decomposition algorithm isolates high-, mid-, and low-frequency structures from FTSE 100 constituents over 20 years. These are used to forecast the forthcoming quarter's covariance structure to weight the portfolio based on the RPP strategy. These fully funded pensions are compared against the performance of a fully unfunded pension using the FTSE 100 index performance as a proxy.;;;;;;;;;1;0;0;0;0;0;1;;;1748-4995;1748-5002;;;;;;;;;;Heriot Watt Univ, Sch Math & Comp Sci, Edinburgh, ScotlandUniv Calif Santa Barbara, Dept Stat & Appl Probabil, Santa Barbara, CA USAResilientML, Melbourne, Australia;ResilientML;;;2024-05-22;WOS:001221233500001;;

The paper finds evidence that crashes depend more on prospective fiscal deficits than on actual ones, and more on the composition of public debt (that is, rollover/sudden stop risk) than on its level. The paper also uncovers significant nonlinear effects at high levels of public debt as well as significantly negative risk premiums for major reserve currencies, which enjoy a lower probability of currency crash than other currencies ceteris paribus. Yet, the estimates indicate that such premiums remain small in size relative to the conditional probability of a currency crash if prospective fiscal deficits or rollover/sudden stop risk are high.;;;;;;;;;6;0;0;0;0;0;12;;;2041-4161;;;;;;;;;;;European Cent Bank, Div DG Int, Frankfurt, Germany;;;;2012-02-07;WOS:000298045900006;;

Hence, there should be a strong link between monetary policy rate uncertainty and equity return volatility, both in theory and data. This paper uses regression-based projections for realized variance to examine the relationship between short horizon forecasts of equity variance and proxies for monetary policy rate uncertainty. By assessing various projection models for UK, US and euro area equity indices, we show that the proxies for monetary policy rate uncertainty have a significant and positive predictive power for the equity return variance. Adding monetary policy rate uncertainty variables can significantly improve forecasting models for equity variance and volatility at weekly, monthly and even quarterly horizons. The findings imply that market views of short-term interest rate developments may indeed be embedded in equity prices and their variations. (C) 2017 The Bank of England. Published by Elsevier B.V.

Related research has either emphasized the effects of the central bank instrument and/or outcome or exclusively the impact of a unique central bank institutional characteristic, but never all of them as a core part of a unified framework. We fulfill this gap by providing evidence on whether the stock market volatility from Flexible Inflation Targeting (FIT) countries is less than volatility from non-FIT countries. Using data on a large set of emerging and employing causal inference methods, we examine the impact of FIT on stock market volatility. The results demonstrate that FIT is effective in containing volatility. By anchoring market operators' expectations, FIT shapes the risk premium, which compensates for inflation uncertainty by lowering its main component, i.e. uncertainty, hence eventually bringing down the stock market volatility.;;;;;;;;;8;0;0;0;0;0;9;;;0264-9993;1873-6122;;;;;;;;;;Univ Sousse, IHEC, BP 40 Route ceinture Sahloul III, Sousse 4054, Tunisia;;;;2023-08-21;WOS:001044613200001;;

The safe-haven property of credit VIX is pronounced for high-yield bonds which embed a high credit risk-premium. This result stands when taking into account interest rate volatility, as measured by the MOVE index. A time-varying analysis shows the persistence of credit VIX as a safe-haven for all bond sectors after the COVID-19 pandemic and during a high US interest-rate regime.

It proposes a multifactor stochastic pricing model, with time-varying risk premiums calibrated with filtered futures and analyst forecasts using a Kalman Filter.The forecasting model is applied to ten years of oil prices and analyst forecasts, from NYMEX and Bloomberg, respectively. Results are very encouraging showing that the model forecasts are much better than the no-change forecasts, commonly used as a benchmark, and better than those from the widely used Bloomberg's Consensus Expected Price Model.

From January 2005 to December 2018, the study examines how Dynamic Bayesian Networks can be utilized to estimate portfolio risk and return as well as determine inter-factor relationships among reversal profit-generating components in Pakistan's emerging market (PSX). The goal of this article is to uncover the factors that cause reversal profits in the Pakistani stock market. In visual form, Bayesian networks can generate causal and inferential probabilistic relationships. Investors might update their stock return values in the network simultaneously with fresh market information, resulting in a dynamic shift in portfolio risk distribution across the networks. The findings show that investments in low net profit margin, low investment, and high volatility-based designed portfolios yield the biggest dynamical reversal profits. The main triggering aspects related to generation reversal profits in the Pakistan market, in the long run, are net profit margin, market risk premium, investment, size, and volatility factor.

The reforms in general practice have primarily been driven by the discussions of the implications of climate change and environmental degradation. Central to the discussion has been the social discount rate, used to value future costs and benefits in the present, and also the dual discount rates for environmental goods, as goods that are of no, or of risky substitution. Official rates, in many nations, are calculated using the Ramsey formula. The literature has explored the relevant factors in this formula, but with less attention paid to the selection of the rate of future growth in consumption, or to the setting of dual discount rates in national practice guidance. Through considering the case of Ireland, this study demonstrates that the selection of growth rates in consumption, in the context of future uncertainty, requires the use of plausible scenarios, rather than historical trends or forecasts. By employing economic scenarios, alongside established values for the other factors, the main discount rate for Ireland is calculated in a range of 1.7 to 2.8 per cent. Seperately, a dual discount rate, for capital that cannot be replaced, is estimated at <= 1.3 per cent. The main discount rate is validated by comparison against discount rates found in the literature, applied in other comparable nations, and by the rate estimated from the real yield on government bonds. All four independent lines of evidence support the range estimated. This demonstrates that the Irish government's estimated discount rate, of 4.0 per cent, is not credible, and needs reduction, alongside introduction of dual discounting.;;;;;;;;;8;0;0;0;3;0;8;;;2643-1092;;;;;;;;;;;Univ Turku, Finland Futures Res Ctr, Akerlundinkatu 2, FI-33100 Tampere, Finland;;;;2021-08-03;WOS:000677685400002;;

Daily aggregate retail attention (ARA) negatively predicts one-week-ahead market returns, is associated with aggregate retail order imbalance and flows to equity mutual funds, and exhibits a stronger predictability during periods of high marketwide uncertainty, poor liquidity, or more costly short selling. In contrast, aggregate institutional attention (AIA), when observed before major news announcements, positively predict future marketwide returns. In cross-sectional analysis, we show that the predictability is stronger for ARA among illiquid stocks and for AIA among high-beta stocks. The predictability results are robust out-of-sample and correspond to meaningful expected utility gains even for diversified investors. The findings are consistent with the idea that attention-driven retail buying can generate an aggregate price pressure on the stock market, whereas institutional attention precedes the resolution of marketwide uncertainty and the accrual of risk premiums.;;;;;;;;;2;0;0;0;0;0;2;;;0025-1909;1526-5501;;;;;;;;;;Univ Notre Dame, Mendoza Coll Business, Notre Dame, IN 46556 USACUNY, Baruch Coll, Zicklin Sch Business, Dept Econ & Finance, New York, NY 10010 USANatl Taiwan Univ, Dept Finance, Taipei City 106, TaiwanNatl Taiwan Univ, Ctr Res Econometr Theory & Applicat, Taipei City 106, Taiwan;;;;2025-05-21;WOS:001489131800001;;

The usual bond valuation methods rely on yield curves, risk premium, and other parameters to estimate interest rates used in discounted cash flow calculations. The option to retire the bond is, however, neglected in the standard pricing models, causing a systematic overvaluation of callable bonds. In the event of a decline in interest rates, investors are exposed to the risk of a lower return on investment than indicated by the yield to maturity. We propose a novel approach to valuing the risk that the issuer will use the right to buy back the bond at a specific call price. While prior models are focused on valuing marketable callable bonds, we deliver a unique approach to valuing bonds with an embedded European option (or a multiple option) that are traded solely through private transactions.

Since they are flexible models with tractable analytic properties, financial modelling with TDs has become increasing popular in recent years. We first provide a formal classification of TD models into drift-driven, diffusion-driven, and distribution-driven according to their empirical emphases and specification strategies. Motivated by the stylized distributional features of VIX such as skewness and excess kurtosis, we then propose a pair of new distribution-driven TDs for modelling VIX dynamics and pricing VIX futures by directly incorporating such information into the specification of the transformation. We conduct a comprehensive empirical investigation into the relative performance of the three classes of models against several empirically relevant criteria. Our focus is on the in-sample goodness-of-fit measure and the out-of-sample forecast accuracy for modelling VIX and pricing VIX futures, as well as the stock return predictability of the implied Variance Risk Premium. Our findings demonstrate that the newly proposed distribution-driven models have clear advantages over well-established alternatives in most of our exercises. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

However, these instruments are mostly available in advanced economies, whereas the market for credit derivatives in emerging market countries, including Turkey, is limited in terms of liquidity and maturity. In this regard, this study aims to construct a proxy for the credit risk of the Turkish Treasury and banking sector in international markets by calculating asset swap spread for US dollar-denominated fixed coupon eurobonds, which requires a robust estimation of the relevant yield curves. The study firstly presents the estimation of the sovereign and banking sector yield curves and then constructs a synthetic asset swap structure to obtain embedded credit risk premia in the eurobond curves. Our findings show that the proposed credit risk indicator is vastly correlated with credit default swap premium. In addition to this, estimated eurobond curves are also useful for monitoring borrowing cost dynamics of the Turkish Treasury and banking sector in international markets.

A new CDS-based approach to estimate current expected credit loss is proposed for low default portfolios, containing credit exposures to corporate issuers covered by publicly traded CDS contracts. First, a fraction of CDS spread related to a pure default compensation for different CDS maturities is assessed. Our results contrast with previous research. Second, based on the obtained historical weights of the default risk premium, a forward-looking term structure of the probabilities of default implied by the current CDS quotes is derived. The proposed approach covers both investment and noninvestment grade debt. The resulting framework is applied to a sample of corporate bonds.

As the DCEV model maintains the linear drift, an analytic formula is available to efficiently infer latent variances from VIX levels, after which both its physical and risk-neutral parameters can be simultaneously estimated with the maximum-likelihood approach given S&P 500 returns and inferred variances. The DCEV model outperforms the CEV and NLD models in in-sample fitting performance and in out-of-sample variance forecasting under the physical measure. It also exhibits superior ability in out-of-sample option pricing over the CEV and models under the risk-neutral measure. This satisfactory performance demonstrates the suitability of describing volatility dynamics with the DCEV model and the potential of applying this to study other issues.;;;;;;;;;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;;;1479-8409;1479-8417;;;;;;;;;;Natl Taiwan Univ, 1,Sec 4,Roosevelt Rd, Taipei 10617, Taiwan;;;;2022-05-11;WOS:000790073000001;;

To highlight unifying themes, I develop a stylized macroeconomic model that embeds several mechanisms. With short-selling constraints, speculation can generate overvaluation and speculative bubbles. Leverage can substantially inflate speculative bubbles, and leverage limits depend on perceived downside risks. Shifts in beliefs about downside tail scenarios can explain the emergence and the collapse of leveraged speculative bubbles. Speculative bubbles are related to rational bubbles, but they match better the empirical evidence on the predictability of asset returns. Even without short-selling constraints, speculation induces procyclical asset valuation. When speculation affects the price of aggregate assets, it also influences macroeconomic outcomes such as aggregate consumption, investment, and output. Speculation in the boom years reduces asset prices, aggregate demand, and output in the subsequent recession. Macroprudential policies that restrict speculation in the boom can improve macroeconomic stability and social welfare.;;;;;;;;;12;0;0;0;0;0;24;;;1941-1383;;978-0-8243-4613-3;;;;;;;;;MIT, Dept Econ, Cambridge, MA 02142 USANBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USACtr Econ Policy Res, London EC1V 0DX, England;;;;2021-08-26;WOS:000685106100014;;

However, the traditional optimal power flow (OPF)-based total transfer capability calculation is computationally expensive for efficient total transfer capability control due to the inclusion of a large set of differential-algebraic equations (DAEs) to verify transient stability constraints. In order to enable practicable total transfer capability regulation, a novel risk-aware deep learning-assisted paradigm is proposed here. First, a deep belief network (DBN) is employed to establish the total transfer capability predictor and surrogate the computation-intensive differential-algebraic equations in original optimal power flow formulas, simplifying the high-dimensional and intractable constraints deep belief networks without loss of nonlinearity. Particularly, in order to be aware of control risk from the predictive error of the deep belief networks, prediction intervals (PIs) are produced improved by using ensemble learning and used to disclose the probability of insufficient actions, further guaranteeing the sufficient and cost-effective control by compromising the tradeoff between cost and risk. Symbiotic organisms search (SOS) is then applied to solve the proposed risk-aware deep belief network-assisted total transfer capability control problem globally. The numerical studies testify that the proposed method enables economical, reliable, and full nonlinearity-retained dynamic total transfer capability regulation control within a risk-free surrogate-assisted and tractable physical model-driven hybrid framework.;;;;;;;;;16;1;0;0;2;0;16;;;1751-8687;1751-8695;;;;;;;;;;Sichuan Univ, Coll Elect Engn, Chengdu, Sichuan, Peoples R ChinaUniv Wisconsin, Dept Elect Engn & Comp Sci, Milwaukee, WI 53201 USA;;;;2021-03-16;WOS:000621581800001;;

Historical stock market behavior and recent empirical experience have led economists and policy makers to acknowledge that price bubbles in financial markets do occur and need to be accounted for in risk analysis. New econometric tools for analyzing mildly explosive behavior (Phillips and Magdalinos, 2007; Phillips et al., 2011) have made it possible to detect the presence of bubbles in data and to date stamp their origination and collapse, providing empirical confirmation of such episodes in recent data. The potential for price bubbles and market collapse provides another source of stock market risk and adds to the risk premium. We provide an analytic and empirical investigation of this additional risk factor. The standard present value model is extended to allow for possible price bubbles and the effects of integrating bubble behavior into a consumption-based asset pricing model are analyzed. The theory involves attention to the investor time horizon and a study of the validity of conventional log linear approximations in the presence of nonstationary and mildly explosive data. Finite decision horizons accommodate myopic investors and are a component of speculative behavior that focuses on short run market gains rather than long run effects of fundamentals. An econometric approach to estimate bubble risk effects is developed and the methods are applied to composite stock market index data, giving new model-based equity premium and market volatility estimates that more closely match the data than traditional consumption based asset pricing models.

The study investigates the underlying parameters defining the project-specific risk premium attached to an offshore wind project. These parameters are modelled as stochastic variables, and a probabilistic financial analysis is conducted using Monte Carlo Simulation. To calculate an interest rate based on operational characteristics, the present study assumes that two net present value equations yielding the same result can be written where certainty equivalent cash flows discounted at the risk-free rate and b) expected cash flows discounted at the cost of capital. The project-related risk is then estimated by solving the resulting equation for the unknown cost of capital. The macroeconomic factors are also considered as they impact the uncertainty associated with revenue and operating expenditure. The model developed to calculate the cost of capital is validated by comparing it with the data obtained for publicly traded renewable energy companies worldwide. Finally, the developed model is demonstrated for a fictitious ageing offshore wind farm under different economic circumstances.

Powerful deep learning methods for alpha factor mining lack interpretability, making them unacceptable in the risk-sensitive real markets. Formulaic alpha factors are preferred for their interpretability, while the search space is complex and powerful explorative methods are urged. Recently, a promising framework is proposed for generating formulaic alpha factors using deep reinforcement learning, and quickly gained research focuses from both academia and industries. This paper first argues that the originally employed policy training method, i.e., Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO), faces several important issues in the context of alpha factors mining. Herein, a novel reinforcement learning algorithm based on the well-known REINFORCE algorithm is proposed. REINFORCE employs Monte Carlo sampling to estimate the policy gradient-yielding unbiased but high variance estimates. The minimal environmental variability inherent in the underlying state transition function, which adheres to the Dirac distribution, can help alleviate this high variance issue, making REINFORCE algorithm more appropriate than PPO. A new dedicated baseline is designed to theoretically reduce the commonly suffered high variance of REINFORCE. Moreover, the information ratio is introduced as a reward shaping mechanism to encourage the generation of steady alpha factors that can better adapt to changes in market volatility. Evaluations on real assets data indicate the proposed algorithm boosts correlation with returns by 3.83%, and a stronger ability to obtain excess returns compared to the latest alpha factors mining methods, which meets the theoretical results well.;;;;;;;;;2;0;0;0;0;0;2;;;1053-587X;1941-0476;;;;;;;;;;Southern Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Comp Sci & Engn, Dept Stat & Data Sci, Guangdong Prov Key Lab Brain Inspired Intelligent, Shenzhen 518055, Peoples R ChinaShenzhen Yujin Hedge Fund Co Ltd, Shenzhen 518033, Peoples R ChinaUniv Sci & Technol China, Dept Modern Phys, Hefei 230026, Peoples R ChinaShenzhen Yujin Hedge Fund Co Ltd, Shenzhen 518033, Peoples R China;Shenzhen Yujin Hedge Fund Co LtdShenzhen Yujin Hedge Fund Co Ltd;;;2025-07-10;WOS:001522924100002;;

Such BOP imbalance was blamed for massive foreign exchange investment flows from Asia into the U.S., triggering the financial and real estate bubble in America. The latter refers to the excessively loose monetary policy of the U.S. Federal Reserve, which pushed financial institutions and households into reckless investment behavior in search of higher returns. Given the abuse of certain innovative financial techniques and new investment instruments that have been created in recent decades, both collateralized debt obligations (CDOs) and credit default swaps (CDS) enjoyed a symbiotic and toxic relationship prior to the financial crisis This paper is organized as follows: The first section analyzes the real causes of the recent financial crisis. The second details the role of CDOs and CDS. Then, to identify key determinants of the CDS spreads in an emerging capital market, the sample data of major Korean firms’ CDS spreads are used to estimate the risk premium by utilizing the multiple regression analysis. The empirical test result indicates that Korean 3-year treasury bond rate(TYIELD), market to book value ratio(MV/BV), and assets size(INASSETS) are shown to demonstrate statistically significant influences on the changes of the CDS premium for sample firms.;;;;;;;;;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;;;1975-4701;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;2011-01-01;KJD:ART001600089;;

Using the local projection method (Jorda 2004, 2005, 2009), we forecast the dynamic responses of the betas of hedge fund strategies to macroeconomic and financial shocks-especially volatility and illiquidity shocks-over the subprime crisis in order to investigate their market timing activities. In a robustness check, using TVAR (Balke 2000), we simulate the reaction of hedge fund strategies' betas in extreme scenarios allowing moderate and strong adverse shocks. Our results show that the behavior of hedge fund strategies regarding the monitoring of systematic risk is highly nonlinear in extreme scenarios-especially during the subprime crisis. We find that countercyclical strategies have an investment technology which differs from procyclical ones. During crises, the former seek to capture non-traditional risk premia by deliberately increasing their systematic risk while the later focus more on minimizing risk. Our results suggest that the hedge fund strategies' betas respond more to illiquidity uncertainty than to illiquidity risk during crises.

The model explains accepted loan applications and simultaneously determines loan sizes and interest rates. A competitive and a discriminating monopoly version of the model are proposed. Offered interest rates and loan sizes are a function of observable borrower characteristics. The competitive model rests on a marginal condition, reflecting contract optimality, to which a zero-profit condition is added. In contrast, the discriminating monopoly maximizes profits under a borrower participation constraint, reflecting the availability of a rental market as an outside option. Each version of the model is a bivariate, nonlinear model, and is estimated by standard maximum likelihood methods. The data used for estimation is a sample of clients of a French network of mortgage lenders. We show the presence of social discrimination in the data, the loan conditions depending not only on the borrower's wage and down payment, but also on the borrower's occupational status. Abnormally high risk premia in the competitive version of the model suggest the presence of market power, justifying an attempt at estimating its monopolistic version. The discriminating monopoly model estimates show that the borrowers' price-elasticity of demand for housing varies with occupational status, and is inversely related with the lender's interest rate markups. This confirms that the lender exploits structural differences in the preferences to discriminate, as predicted by standard theories. (C) 2003 Elsevier B.V.

While machine learning models have demonstrated their efficacy in stock price forecasting, they rely solely on historical price data, which, given the inherent volatility and dynamic nature of financial markets, are insufficient to address the complexity and uncertainty in long-term forecasting due to the limited connection between historical and forecasting prices. This paper introduces a pioneering approach that integrates financial theory with advanced deep learning methods to enhance predictive accuracy and risk management in China's stock index futures market. The SF-Transformer model, combining spot-forward parity and the Transformer model, is proposed to improve forecasting accuracy across short and long-term horizons. Formulated upon the arbitrage-free futures pricing model, the spot-forward parity model offers variables such as stock index price, risk-free rate, and stock index dividend yield for forecasting. Our insight is that the mutual information generated by these variables has the potential to significantly reduce uncertainty in long-term forecasting. A case study on predicting major stock index futures prices in China demonstrates the superiority of the SF-Transformer model over models based on LSTM, MLP, and the stock index futures arbitrage-free pricing model, covering both short and long-term forecasting up to 28 days. Unlike existing machine learning models, the Transformer processes entire time series concurrently, leveraging its attention mechanism to discern intricate dependencies and capture long-range relationships, thereby offering a holistic understanding of time series data. An enhancement of mutual information is observed after introducing spot-forward parity in the forecasting. The variation of mutual information and ablation study results highlights the significant contributions of spot-forward parity, particularly to the long-term forecasting. Overall, these findings highlight the SF-Transformer model's efficacy in leveraging spot-forward parity for reducing uncertainty and advancing robust and comprehensive approaches in long-term stock index futures price forecasting.;;;;;;;;;2;0;0;0;0;0;2;;;;1099-4300;;;;;;;;;;Cent South Univ, Business Sch, Changsha 410083, Peoples R ChinaCent South Univ, Sch Comp & Engn, Changsha 410083, Peoples R ChinaCent South Univ, Sch Geosci & Infophys, Changsha 410083, Peoples R China;;;;2024-07-04;WOS:001256746700001;38920487;

The main goal of this work is to discover the role played by expected wind production, together with other relevant factors, in explaining the day-ahead market price through a data panel model. The Spanish market, given the huge increase in wind generation observed in the last decade, has been chosen for this study as a paradigmatic example. The results obtained suggest that wind power forecasts are a new key determinant for supply market participants when bidding in the day-ahead market. We also provide a conservative quantification of the effect of such trading strategies on marginal prices at an hourly level for a specific year in the sample. The consequence has been an increase in marginal price to levels higher than what could be expected in a context with notable wind penetration. Therefore, the findings of this work are of interest to practitioners and regulators and support the existence of a wind risk premium embedded in electricity prices to compensate for the uncertainty of wind production.;;;;;;;;;3;0;0;0;0;1;3;;;2071-1050;;;;;;;;;;;Bionline, Paterna 46980, SpainUniv Valencia, Dept Financial Econ, Valencia 46010, Spain;Bionline;;;2017-09-19;WOS:000408861800033;;

The growing presence of financial operators in the oil markets has led to the diffusion of trading techniques based on extrapolative expectations. Strategies of this kind foster feedback trading that may cause considerable departures of prices from their fundamental values. We investigate this hypothesis using a modified CAPM following Shiller (1984) and Sentana and Wadhwani (1992). First, a univariate GARCH(1,1)-M is estimated assuming the risk premium to be a function of the conditional oil price volatility. The single factor model, however, is outperformed by the multifactor ICAPM (Merton, 1973), which takes into account a larger investment opportunity set. Analysis is then carried out using a trivariate CCC GARCH-M model with complex nonlinear conditional mean equations where oil price dynamics are associated with both stock market and exchange rate behavior. We find strong evidence that oil price shifts are negatively related to stock price and exchange rate changes and that a complex web of time-varying first and second order conditional moment interactions affects both the CAPM and feedback trading components of the model. Despite the difficulties, we identify a significant role played by speculation in the oil market, which is consistent with the observed large daily upward and downward shifts in prices - a clear evidence that it is not a fundamental-driven market. Thus, from a policy point of view - given the impact of volatile oil prices on global inflation and growth - actions that monitor speculative activities on commodity markets more effectively are to be welcomed.

Traditional forecasting models face significant limitations in capturing long-term trends, addressing abrupt volatility, and mitigating multi-source noise within complex market environments characterized by nonlinear interactions and extreme events. Current research predominantly focuses on single-model approaches (e.g., ARIMA or standalone neural networks), inadequately addressing the synergistic effects of multimodal market signals (e.g., cross-market index linkages, exchange rate fluctuations, and policy shifts) and lacking the systematic validation of model robustness under extreme events. Furthermore, feature selection often relies on empirical assumptions, failing to uncover non-explicit correlations between market factors and gold futures prices. A review of the global literature reveals three critical gaps: (1) the insufficient integration of temporal dependency and global attention mechanisms, leading to imbalanced predictions of long-term trends and short-term volatility; (2) the neglect of dynamic coupling effects among cross-market risk factors, such as energy ETF-metal market spillovers; and (3) the absence of hybrid architectures tailored for high-frequency noise environments, limiting predictive utility for decision support. This study proposes a three-stage LSTM-Transformer-XGBoost fusion framework. Firstly, XGBoost-based feature importance ranking identifies six key drivers from thirty-six candidate indicators: the NASDAQ Index, S&P 500 closing price, silver futures, USD/CNY exchange rate, China's 1-year Treasury yield, and Guotai Zhongzheng Coal ETF. Second, a dual-channel deep learning architecture integrates LSTM for long-term temporal memory and Transformer with multi-head self-attention to decode implicit relationships in unstructured signals (e.g., market sentiment and climate policies). Third, rolling-window forecasting is conducted using daily gold futures prices from the Shanghai Futures Exchange (2015-2025). Key innovations include the following: (1) a bidirectional LSTM-Transformer interaction architecture employing cross-attention mechanisms to dynamically couple global market context with local temporal features, surpassing traditional linear combinations; (2) a Dynamic Hierarchical Partition Framework (DHPF) that stratifies data into four dimensions (price trends, volatility, external correlations, and event shocks) to address multi-driver complexity; (3) a dual-loop adaptive mechanism enabling endogenous parameter updates and exogenous environmental perception to minimize prediction error volatility. This research proposes innovative cross-modal fusion frameworks for gold futures forecasting, providing financial institutions with robust quantitative tools to enhance asset allocation optimization and strengthen risk hedging strategies. It also provides an interpretable hybrid framework for derivative pricing intelligence. Future applications could leverage high-frequency data sharing and cross-market risk contagion models to enhance China's influence in global gold pricing governance.";;;;;;;;;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;;;;2227-7390;;;;;;;;;;North China Univ Technol, Sch Econ & Management, Beijing 100114, Peoples R China;;;;2025-05-30;WOS:001496328800001;;

The analysis is conducted for five inflation targeting countries (the UK, Canada, Australia, New Zealand and Sweden) and three non-targeters (the US, the Euro-Area and Switzerland) using daily data from January 2000 to December 2020. While we cannot confirm the validity of UIP in its strictest theoretical sense, we find evidence for the existence of an equilibrium relationship between the exchange rate and the interest rate differential. Specifically, the nonlinear framework appears to be more appropriate to capture the adjustment towards the long-run equilibrium, since the estimated speed of adjustment is substantially faster and the short-run dynamic linkages more significant. Further, interest rate expectations play an important role: a fast adjustment only occurs when the market expects the interest rate to increase in the near future, namely central banks are perceived as more credible when sticking to their goal of keeping inflation at a low and stable rate. Also, central bank announcements have a more sizeable short-run effect in the nonlinear model. Finally, the equilibrium relationship between the exchange rate and the interest rate differential holds better in inflation targeting countries, where monetary authorities appear to achieve a higher degree of credibility.;;;;;;;;;2;0;0;0;0;0;2;;;0923-7992;1573-708X;;;;;;;;;;London South Bank Univ, London, EnglandBrunel Univ London, Dept Econ & Finance, London UB8 3PH, England;;;;2022-02-26;WOS:000754454300001;;

Therefore, many studies require the model-implied average expected future short rates to be close to short rate expectations from surveys. In this paper, I restrict the variance of changes in model-implied average expected future short rates to match the variance of changes in short rate expectations from surveys. The variance of changes in survey expectations is relatively similar across markets and thus provides a reliable source of additional information about the expectation formation of investors. Technically, I impose a nonlinear restriction to the term structure model of Adrian, Crump, and Moench (2013). I show that typical small sample problems of term structure estimations can be mitigated if the restriction on the variance of changes is imposed. However, the analysis also makes a case for unrestricted estimations if they are based on a dataset with a typical sample length in macro finance.;;;;;;;;;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;;;1062-9769;1878-4259;;;;;;;;;;Deutsch Bundesbank, Mainzer Landstr 46, D-60325 Frankfurt am Main, Germany;;;;2023-08-27;WOS:001050125500001;;

This paper tests for a specific form of forecast bias. In particular, we examine whether expert consensus forecasts of monthly economic releases are systematically biased toward the value of previous months' releases. Such a bias would be consistent with the anchoring and adjustment heuristic described by Tversky and Kahneman (1974) or could arise from professional forecasters' strategic incentives. We find broad-based and significant evidence for this form of bias, which in some cases results in sizable predictable forecast errors. To investigate whether market participants' expectations are influenced by this bias, we examine interest rate reactions to economic news. We find that bond yields react only to the residual, or unpredictable, component of the forecast error and not to the component induced by anchoring, suggesting that expectations of market participants anticipate this bias embedded in expert forecasts.;;;;;;;;;95;0;0;0;1;4;132;;;0022-1090;;;;;;;;;;;Fed Reserve Syst, Board Governors, Washington, DC 20551 USA;;;;2009-04-01;WOS:000268041300005;;

This condition has significant negative impacts on human health and imposes a substantial economic burden. In recent years, scientists and dentists have increasingly started to utilize artificial intelligence (AI), particularly machine learning, to improve the efficiency of dental caries management. This study aims to provide an overview of the current knowledge about the AI-enabled approaches for dental caries management within the framework of personalized patient care. Generally, AI works as a promising tool that can be used by both dental professionals and patients. For dental professionals, it predicts the risk of dental caries by analyzing dental caries risk and protective factors, enabling to formulate personalized preventive measures. AI, especially those based on machine learning and deep learning, can also analyze images to detect signs of dental caries, assist in developing treatment plans, and help to make a risk assessment for pulp exposure during treatment. AI-powered tools can also be used to train dental students through simulations and virtual case studies, allowing them to practice and refine their clinical skills in a risk-free environment. Additionally, AI tracks brushing patterns and provides feedback to improve oral hygiene practices of the patients and the general population, thereby improving their understanding and compliance. This capability of AI can inform future research and the development of new strategies for dental caries management and control. (c) 2025 The Authors.

We propose a model of equity price dynamics that allows for (i) simultaneous consideration of multiple stock prices, (ii) analytical formulas for derivatives such as futures, options and bonds, and (iii) a realistic description of all of these assets. The analytical specification of the model allows us to infer the dynamics of the pricing kernel. The model, calibrated to a comprehensive dataset including the S&P 500 index, individual equities, T-bills and gold futures, yields the conditional filter of the unobservable pricing kernel. As a result we obtain the estimate of the kernel that is positive almost surely (i.e. precludes arbitrage), consistent with the equity risk premium, the risk-free discounting, and with the observed asset prices by construction. The pricing kernel estimate involves a highly nonlinear function of the contemporaneous and lagged returns on the S&P 500 index. This contradicts typical implementations of CAPM that use a linear function of the market proxy return as the pricing kernel. Hence, the S&P 500 index does not have to coincide with the market portfolio if it is used in conjunction with nonlinear asset pricing models. We also find that our best estimate of the pricing kernel is not consistent with the standard time-separable utilities, but potentially could be cast into the stochastic habit formation framework of Campbell and Cochrane (J.

The risk is expressed in different economic terms: the average annual loss (or pure risk premium) and the loss exceedance curve; these metrics are of particular importance for risk retention (financing) schemes or risk transfer instruments.

According to this expected inflation channel, government spending drives up expected inflation, which in turn, reduces the real interest rate and leads to an increase in private consumption. This paper examines whether the channel was important in the post-WWII U.S., with particular attention to the 2009 Recovery Act period. First, we show that a model calibrated to have a large output multiplier requires a large response of expected inflation to a government spending shock. Next, we show that this large response is inconsistent with structural vector autoregression evidence from the Federal Reserve's passive policy period (1959-1979). Then, we study expected inflation measures during the Recovery Act period in conjunction with a panel of professional forecaster surveys, a cross-country comparison of bond yields and fiscal policy news announcements. We show that the expected inflation response was too small to engender a large output multiplier. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

This study examines the role of debt thresholds and debt composition in driving the nonlinear behaviour of long-term interest rates through a novel approach, a panel smooth transition regression with a general logistic model. The main findings are threefold. First, the impact of the expected public debt level on interest rates rises exponentially when the share of foreign private holdings exceeds approximately 20% of government debt denominated in local currency. Second, if the public debt level exceeds a certain level, an increase in foreign private holding of government debt could raise interest rates, offsetting the downward pressure from higher market liquidity. Third, out-of-sample forecasts of this novel non-linear model are more accurate than those of previous methods.;;;;;;;;;1;0;0;0;0;0;1;;;0305-9049;1468-0084;;;;;;;;;;World Bank, Prospects Grp, 1818 H St NW, Washington, DC 20433 USA;;;;2021-12-03;WOS:000723006900001;;

To this end, a post Keynesian endogenous growth model is presented, in which: (1) the desired rate of capital accumulation is assumed to be a nonlinear function of external indebtedness as a share of capital stock; (2) an endogenous country risk premium is assumed to be an increasing (linear) function of external indebtedness (as a share of capital stock); (3) there is a fixed exchange rate regime and perfect capital mobility in the sense of Mundell and Fleming. The main theoretical result of the model is the existence of two long-run equilibrium positions, one of which has a high level of external indebtedness (as a ratio of capital stock) and a low profit rate and the other has a low level of external indebtedness and a high profit rate. This means that excessive external indebtedness can result in stagnant growth due to its negative effect on the rate of profit. To test the effects of external indebtedness on the rate of economic growth in emerging economies, a dynamic panel is estimated to evaluate whether external debt has an effective negative influence on economic growth in emerging countries. An empirical test of demand-led growth equations with a dynamic panel for fifty-five emerging countries confirms the potential negative effects of external debt on long-term growth rates in the sample countries.";;;;;;;;;5;0;0;1;0;1;12;;;0160-3477;1557-7821;;;;;;;;;;Inst Appl Econ Res IPEA, Brasilia, DF, BrazilUniv Brasilia, Dept Econ, BR-70910900 Brasilia, DF, BrazilCNPq, Natl Council Sci & Technol Dev, Brasilia, DF, Brazil;CNPq;;;2013-08-07;WOS:000321654300005;;

Deep learning methodologies, including LSTM, GRU, CNN, and TFT, with machine learning algorithms such as XGBoost, LightGBM, and SVR, were employed to identify the optimal prediction model for the Bitcoin price. The findings indicate that the TFT model is the most successful predictive approach, with the gold price identified as the most relevant component in determining the Bitcoin price. After the gold indicator, the US dollar index was a substantial factor in the explanation of the Bitcoin price. The TFT model also included regulatory decisions and global events. It was estimated that the Bitcoin price was significantly influenced by the COVID-19 pandemic. After that, global climate events and China mining ban strongly affected the Bitcoin price. These findings indicate that regulatory decisions and global events determine the Bitcoin price in addition to macroeconomic factors. The VAR analysis was employed as a robustness check. The results indicate that gold and oil prices have a strong negative influence on Bitcoin, particularly in the long term.

Stock market volatility is non-Gaussian distributed. It can be approximated by an inverse Gaussian (IG) distribution or it can be transformed by Box-Cox transformation to a Gaussian distribution. Hence, we used a Box-Cox transformed Gaussian LASSO model and an IG GLM LASSO model as dimension reduction techniques and we attempted to identify some common indicators to help us forecast stock market volatility. Via simulation, we validated the use of four models, i.e., a univariate Box-Cox transformation Gaussian LASSO model, a three-phase iterative grid search Box-Cox transformation Gaussian LASSO model, and both canonical link and optimal link IG GLM LASSO models. The latter two models assume an approximately IG distributed response. Using these four models in an empirical study, we identified three macroeconomic indicators that could help us forecast stock market volatility.

The authors use the data of 3,205 non-financial corporate bonds from February 2010 to October 2017 and construct a new spread noted as the PE_SOE spread. The authors find that the PE_SOE spread has a negative impact on economic activities and has the best predictive ability at short-run forecasting horizons, owing to the institutional superiority of the state-owned enterprises in China. The Treasury bond yields are found to have the best predictive ability at long-run horizons. Both spread shock and Treasury yield shock could lead to deflation and declines in economic activities, and the Treasury yield shock has a more severe and persistent impact on the economy due to the financial accelerator mechanism. PE_SOE spread is proved to be a better indicator for Chinese corporate bond market and can be widely used not only in future Chinese economic studies, but also for Chinese government's macroeconomic monitoring and warning.;;;;;;;;;5;0;0;0;0;0;5;;;1009-6124;1559-7067;;;;;;;;;;Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Sch Econ & Management, Beijing 100190, Peoples R ChinaChinese Acad Sci, Acad Math & Syst Sci, Beijing 100190, Peoples R China;;;;2019-08-26;WOS:000480484700010;;

In addition, the authors analyze the integration of the commodity, bond, forex and equity markets across these markets.Design/methodology/approachThe dynamic conditional correlation GARCH (DCC-GARCH) model is used to capture the time-varying conditional correlation among markets. The authors use daily data of stock prices, oil prices, gold prices, exchange rates and 10 years' bond yields of the six countries from Datastream and investing.com from January 2001 to April 2021.FindingsFindings reveal that the parameters of dynamic correlation are statistically significant which indicates the importance of time-varying co-movements.

In doing so, the authors compare European and US firms and consider nonlinear and indirect effects. This complements the previous literature focusing on linear and direct effects using bond yields and credit ratings of US firms. Design/methodology/approach For this purpose, the authors apply fixed effects regressions on a comprehensive panel data set of US and European firms. Further, nonlinear and indirect effects are investigated utilizing quantile regressions and a path analysis. Findings The evidence indicates that higher ESG ratings mitigate credit risks of US and European firms from 2007 to 2019. The risk mitigation effect is U-shaped across ESG quantiles, which is consistent with opposing effects of growing stakeholder influence capacity and diminishing marginal returns on ESG investments. The authors further reveal a mediating indirect volatility channel that substantially amplifies the direct effect of ESG on credit risk. A one-standard-deviation improvement in ESG ratings is estimated to reduce CDS spreads of low, medium and high ESG firms by approximately 4%, 8% and 3%, respectively. Originality/value This is the first study to examine whether credit markets reflect regional differences between Europe and the US with regard to the ESG-CDS-relationship. In addition, this paper contributes to the existing literature by investigating differences in the response of CDS spreads across ESG quantiles and to study potential indirect channels connecting ESG and CDS spreads using structural credit risk variables.;;;;;;;;;57;0;0;0;3;0;72;;;1526-5943;2331-2947;;;;;;;;;;QPLIX, Munich, GermanyHUK COBURG Asset Management GmbH, Coburg, GermanyFriedrich Alexander Univ Erlangen Nuremberg, Nurnberg, Germany;QPLIXHUK COBURG Asset Management GmbH;;;2022-02-02;WOS:000751646200001;;

Price rigidity, capacity constraints, and adjustment costs are just some reasons why depreciation and appreciation of the real effective exchange rate do not necessarily have equally strong effect of the opposite direction on net exports. Econometric estimation by nonlinear autoregressive distributed lags method (NARDL) enables separation of positive (appreciation) from negative (depreciation) changes in the real effective exchange rate, showing that its changes do not affect net exports sym-metrically and linearly. Existence of J-curve and positive impact of the real effective exchange rate depreciation on trade balance (Marshall-Lerner condition) are confirmed, while appreciation has no significant effect. Results obtained in this paper point out that Croatia `s foreign trade bal-ance can be improved by real effective exchange rate depreciation. However, this should be taken with caution given that nominal depreciation leads to growing external indebtedness of domestic economy, affects expectations, especially those related to inflation, import prices (therefore domes-tic prices), risk premium, returns on financial assets, and there are indications that depreciation of nominal and real exchange rate in Croatia have a contractional effect on domestic economic activity, so costs of such a policy may far outweigh the benefits of currency weakening. In addition, research limitations include low variability of the real effective exchange rate (which might make it difficult to obtain econometric relevant estimates), the problem of choosing representative exchange rate measures, and the choice of proxy variables for domestic and foreign income. In the observed period, appreciation and depreciation of the real effective exchange rate were relatively mild, so the conclusions are not necessarily valid in the case of a sudden and large fluctuations in it. Compared to previous research, asymmetric effect of the real effective exchange rate is confirmed on the bal-ance of goods and services (not only balance of goods), and possible causes of nonlinearity in the response of foreign trade balance to changes in the real effective exchange rate are discussed.;;;;;;;;;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;;;0424-7558;1848-9494;;;;;;;;;;Sveuciliste Zagrebu, Ekon Fak, Zagreb, Croatia;;;;2023-07-18;WOS:001022753100004;;

While asset pric-ing theory enhances the use of conditional pricing models, econometric inference of conditional models can be challenging due to misspecification or weak identifica-tion. To tackle the case of misspecification, we utilize the conditional Hansen and Jagannathan (1997) (HJ) distance as studied by Gagliardini and Ronchetti (2016), but we set the focus on interpretation and estimation of the pseudo-true value defined as the argument of the minimum of this distance. While efficient Generalized Method of Moments (GMM) has no meaning for estimation of a pseudo-true value, the HJ-distance not only delivers a meaningful loss function, but also features an additional advantage for the interpretation and estimation of man-aged portfolios whose exact pricing characterizes the pseudo-true pricing kernel (stochastic discount factor (SDF)). For conditionally affine pricing kernels, we can display some managed portfolios which are well-defined independently of the pseudo-true value of the parameters, although their exact pricing is achieved by the pseudo-true SDF. For the general case of nonlinear SDFs, we propose a smooth minimum distance (SMD) estimator (Lavergne and Patilea, 2013) that avoids a focus on specific directions as in the case of managed portfolios. Albeit based on kernel smoothing, the SMD approach avoids instabilities and the resulting need of trim-ming strategies displayed by classical local GMM estimators when the density func-tion of the conditioning variables may take arbitrarily small values. In addition, the fact that SMD may allow fixed bandwidth asymptotics is helpful regarding the curse of dimensionality. In contrast with the true unknown value for a well-specified model, the estimated pseudo-true value, albeit defined in a time-invariant (uncondi-tional) way, may actually depend on the choice of the state variables that define fun-damental factors and their scaling weights. Therefore, we may not want to be overly parsimonious about the set of explanatory variables. Finally, following Antoine and Lavergne (2014), we show how SMD can be further robustified to deal with weaker identification contexts. Since SMD can be seen as a local extension of the method of jackknife GMM (Newey and Windmeijer, 2009), we characterize the Gaussian asymptotic distribution of the estimator of the pseudo-true value using classical U-statistic theorems.;;;;;;;;;7;0;0;0;1;0;10;;;1479-8409;1479-8417;;;;;;;;;;Simon Fraser Univ, Burnaby, BC, CanadaBrown Univ, Providence, RI 02912 USA;;;;2021-01-26;WOS:000606030900002;;

Specifically, we re-examine the regime-dependent feature of univariate predictive regression relative to the benchmark. Furthermore, we investigate the prediction mechanism of the momentum-determined indicator-switching (MDIS) strategy and validate the significance of market regime information for the MDIS. Our findings demonstrate an overwhelmingly superior ex-post forecasting performance compared with the MDIS. More notably, our empirical results substantiate that machine learning greatly aids in momentum indicator selection. The results show that the N-MDIS with machine learning generates more accurate ex-ante equity premium forecasts than both MDIS strategy and N-MDIS strategy with logistic regression, yielding statistically and economically significant results.

Three key contributions are highlighted: (1) the development of dynamic risk assessment algorithms utilizing GRU-CNN for real-time analysis and predictive modeling, enabling proactive disaster mitigation; (2) the establishment of an integrated sensor network infrastructure for early warning systems, leveraging various sensors and GRU-CNN-based data analytics to detect and respond to potential disasters at their nascent stages; and (3) the implementation of human -centric resilience planning, utilizing GRU-CNN-based computeraided tools to simulate disaster scenarios and engage communities in preparedness efforts. The dynamic risk assessment algorithms presented in this paper, powered by GRU-CNN, enable continuous monitoring and analysis of diverse data sources, fostering a proactive approach to disaster preparedness. The integrated sensor network architecture enhances early warning capabilities, allowing for timely responses to emerging threats through the application of GRU-CNN methodologies. Furthermore, the human -centric resilience planning approach introduces virtual simulations using GRU-CNN to model disaster scenarios, facilitating the testing and refinement of strategies in a risk -free environment. This approach not only ensures the adaptability of plans but also engages and educates communities, fostering a culture of preparedness, with GRU-CNN playing a pivotal role in the process. Through these contributions, this research paper seeks to advance the discourse on disaster management in smart urban environments, emphasizing the integration and effectiveness of GRUCNN in enhancing resilience and response strategies.

A common tool used in the relevant forecasting literature is the term spread of Treasury bond yields. In this paper, we decompose the term spread into an expectation and a term premium component and evaluate the informational content of each component in forecasting the GDP growth rate and inflation in various forecasting horizons. In doing so, we employ alternative decomposition procedures and introduce the Support Vector Regression (SVR) methodology from the field of Machine Learning, coupled with linear and nonlinear kernels as a novel forecasting method in the field. Using rolling windows in producing point and conditional probability distribution forecasts we find that neither the term spread, nor its decomposition components possess the ability to accurately forecast output growth or inflation. Our findings extend the existing literature, since they are focused on an explicit out-of-sample evaluation in contrast to most existing empirical studies that produce only in-sample forecasts. To strengthen our findings, we also consider several control variables suggested in the relevant literature without significant qualitative differences from the initial results. The main innovation of our approach stems from the use of the non-linear Support Vectors Machine methodology, that is introduced for the first time in this line of research for forecasting out-of-sample.;;;;;;;;;6;0;0;0;0;0;6;;;1059-0560;1873-8036;;;;;;;;;;Democritus Univ Thrace, Dept Econ, Xanthi, GreeceUniv Pretoria, Dept Econ, Pretoria, South Africa;;;;2019-12-24;WOS:000501613600027;;

This paper explores a Bayesian methodology for estimating weak-form market efficiency under the AMII using a test of evolving efficiency (TEE). More precisely, a generalized TEE (GTEE) approach is proposed in which the conditional first moment of a time series is assumed to be a nonlinear function of its conditional second moment, i.e., a nonlinear feedback term is present in the conditional mean equation. We then discuss a maximum likelihood estimation procedure for the resulting nonlinear model using the state-space approach and extended Kalman filtering. This methodology is used to estimate time-varying, weak-form market efficiency in four, specifically chosen, markets over a time period that includes the global financial crisis of 2007/2008.;;;;;;;;;4;0;0;0;0;0;5;;;0927-6467;1569-3988;;;;;;;;;;Univ Lisbon, Inst Super Tecn, CEMAT, Av Rovisco Pais, P-1049001 Lisbon, PortugalUniv Cape Town, African Inst Financial Markets & Risk Management, ZA-7701 Rondebosch, South Africa;;;;2019-02-19;WOS:000457842400003;;

We analyzed > 712,000 municipal bonds representing nearly 2 trillion USD in par outstanding, focusing on credit spread or the difference between a debt issuer's interest cost to borrow and a benchmark risk-free municipal rate. The relationship between credit spread and physical climate risk is significant and slightly positive, yet the coefficient indicates no meaningful spread penalty for increased physical climate risk. We also find that racial composition (the percent of a community that is Black) explains a statistically significant and meaningful portion of municipal credit spreads, even after controlling for a variety of variables in domains such as geographic location of issuer, bond structure (e.g., bond maturity), credit rating, and non-race economic variables (e.g., per capita income). Assuming 4 trillion USD in annual outstanding par across the entire municipal market, and weighting each issuer by its percent Black, an estimated 19 basis point (bp) penalty for Black Americans sums to approximately 900 million USD annually in aggregate.

NFT coins are cryptocurrencies that facilitate NFT ecosystems by supporting NFT trading and platform governance. Accurate price predictions of NFT coins are crucial for risk managing volatility and constructing optimal portfolios. This study employs machine learning techniques to predict the daily price direction of four key NFT coins, namely ENJ, MANA, THETA, and XTZ. The machine learning methods employed include three decision tree-based methods (random forests, extremely randomized trees, XGBoost), support vector machine, Lasso and Naive Bayes. The findings show that random forests, extremely randomized trees, XGBoost, and support vector machine models have accuracy ranging between 80% and 90% for predictions in the 14 to 21 day range. This adds to the literature showing that machine learning methods have high prediction accuracy for cryptocurrency prices. Conversely, Lasso or Naive Bayes models yield considerably lower prediction accuracy. Feature importance is assessed using Shapley values. The Shapley value feature importance calculated from random forests highlights that, for 14 and 21-day forecasts, four variables -five-year expected inflation, ten-year bond yields, the interest rate spread, and on balance volume -are consistently highly ranked across all NFT coins. Additionally, the MA50, MA200, and WAD also emerge as important features. These results highlight the importance of including macroeconomic variables which capture business cycle conditions and technical analysis indicators that capture investor psychology as features. NFT coin portfolios constructed using trading signals generated from Extra Trees outperforms a buy and hold port-folio.

Such macroeconomic and financial indicators hold predictive power in signaling recessionary periods. However, many indicators are constrained by the fact that data are often published with some delay and are subject to constant revision (Bandholz and Funke 2003, Huanget al 2018, Orphanides 2003). In this research, we propose a leading indicator derived from satellite imagery, the expansion of anthropogenic bare ground. Satellite-detected gain in built-up area, a major land cover and land use (LCLU) outcome of anthropogenic bare ground gain (ABGG), provides an inexpensive, consistent, and near-real-time indicator of global and regional macroeconomic change. Our panel data analysis across four major regions of the world from 2001 to 2012 shows that the logarithm of total ABGG, mostly owing to its major LCLU outcome, the expansion of built-up land in either year t, t - 1 or t - 2, significantly correlated with the year t logarithm of gross domestic product (GDP, de-trended by Hodrick-Prescott filter). Global ABGG between 2001 and 2012 averaged 7875 km(2) yr(-1), with a peak gain of 11 875 (+/- 2014 km(2) at the 95% confidence interval) in 2006, prior to the 2007-2008 global financial crisis. The curve of global ABGG or its major LCLU outcome of built-up area in year t - 1 accords well with that of the de-trended logarithm of the global GDP in year t. Given the 40 year archive of free satellite data, a growing satellite constellation, advances in machine learning, and scalable methods, this study suggests that analyses of ABGG as a whole or its LCLU outcomes can provide valuable information in near-real time for socioeconomic research, development planning, and economic forecasting.;;;;;;;;;5;0;0;0;1;0;7;;;1748-9326;;;;;;;;;;;Univ Maryland, Dept Geog Sci, College Pk, MD 20742 USAChinese Acad Sci, Inst Remote Sensing & Digital Earth, State Key Lab Remote Sensing Sci, Beijing 100101, Peoples R ChinaSOAS Univ London, Sch Finance & Management, London WC1H 0XG, EnglandInt Inst Appl Syst Anal IIASA, A-2361 Laxenburg, Austria;;;;2020-01-06;WOS:000503842000001;;

A long-run relationship among interest rates was established by employing the Vector Error Correction modeling (VECM), which revealed the validation of the Expectation Hypothesis Theory (EH) of the term structure of interest rates, taking into account long-run deviations from equilibrium and inherent nonlinearities. We unveiled short-run dynamic adjustments for the term structure of the BRICS, subject to regime switches. We then used Markov Switching Vector Error Correction models (MS-VECM) to forecast them dynamically during an out-of-sample period of May 2016 through August 2019. The MSIH-VECM forecasts were found to be superior to the VECM approaches.

The previous literature has emphasized the deployment of expert systems and knowledge-discovery approaches motivated by the need to address the limitations of the econometric models. However, it has failed to address the interpretability aspects and, more importantly, the need to provide methodological support that allows the deployment of such techniques in a more systematic way. This approach entails the definition of a process that includes the usual steps taken by experts to address similar problems and allows the relative merits of different techniques in relation to common goals and objectives to be gauged.This paper addresses the interpretability and the lack of methodological support by proposing a knowledge-discovery methodology that includes a minimal common number of steps to model, analyse, evaluate and deploy different non-linear techniques and models. Furthermore, the interpretability is addressed through the use of open-box techniques, such as decision trees.The proposed methodology helps to discover and describe hidden patterns, allowing for the study and characterization of economic cycles, and economic cycle stages, as well as the description of the historic relationships between interest rates and other relevant economic variables. These patterns can also be used in the forecasting of economic cycle stages, interest rates and other related variables of concern. The output of the methodology can provide actionable information for market agents, such as monetary authorities, financial institutions, and individual investors, as well as for the academic community, to increase further the knowledge and understanding of financial markets, thus enriching and complementing existing financial theories.

We treat the functional form of the habit as unknown, and estimate it along with the rest of the model's finite dimensional parameters. Using quarterly data on consumption growth, assets returns and instruments, our empirical results indicate that the estimated habit function is nonlinear, that habit formation is better described as internal rather than external, and the estimated time-preference parameter and the power utility parameter are sensible. In addition, the estimated habit function generates a positive stochastic discount factor (SDF) proxy and performs well in explaining cross-sectional stock return data.

The investment in CSR is measured through a multidimensional financial approach which comprises the sum of the contribution made by the company in the form of charitable donation, employees' welfare and research and development, while the Altman Z-score is used as an indicator of financial distress. The higher the Z-score, the lower will be the probability of financial distress.FindingsThe authors find a significant positive impact of CSR on financial distress in GMM model. This finding is consistent with the shareholder view and over-investment hypothesis of CSR as management makes an investment in CSR to get personal benefits, which resultantly leads the firm toward financial distress state. Further, this positive relationship remains present for firms having strong involvement in foreign business through exports.Research limitations/implicationsLike other studies, the present study is not free from limitations. First, financial firms are skipped from the sample, although literature witnesses a lot of studies highlight the financial firms' commitment to achieving CSR goals. Second, financial distress occurs in different stages, and this study fails to establish a linkage between CSR engagement at different stages of financial distress. In the future, researchers can make valuable addition by covering these missing links in present studies.Practical implicationsFindings suggest several practical implications. For policymakers, they should encourage firms to adopt more socially responsible behavior as it not only prevents them from distress but also comes with better investment behavior, minimize bankruptcies and make economies more strong and stable. Second, results suggest corporate managers emphasize socially responsible behavior as its benefits are beyond the societal benefits as it lessens financial distress through lower cost of debt, lesser financial constraints and reduced cost of information asymmetry, and it minimizes the cost of capital. Lastly, investors make risk premium assessments related to future earnings by determining the likelihood of financial distress in the future.Originality/valueThe study extends the body of existing literature on CSR and the likelihood of financial distress in Pakistan, which is according to the best knowledge of the authors, not yet studied before. The results suggest that policymakers may pay special attention to the quality of CSR while predicting corporate financial distress.;;;;;;;;;26;0;0;0;0;1;29;;;0114-0582;2041-5494;;;;;;;;;;Islamia Univ Bahawalpur, Sch Business Management & Adm Sci, Bahawalpur, Pakistan;;;;2021-06-25;WOS:000662887800001;;

This article investigates model characteristics that are consistent with variation in the shape of return distributions using a stochastic volatility model with a regime-switching feature to allow for random changes in the parameters governing volatility of volatility, leverage effect, and jump intensity. The analysis consists of two steps. First, the models are estimated using only information from observed returns and option-implied volatility. Standard model assessment tools indicate a strong preference in favor of the proposed models. Since the information from option-implied skewness and kurtosis is not used in fitting the models, it is available for diagnostic purposes. In the second step of the analysis, regressions of option-implied skewness and kurtosis on the filtered state variables (and some controls) suggest that the models have strong explanatory power for these characteristics.;;;;;;;;;11;0;0;0;0;0;13;;;0735-0015;1537-2707;;;;;;;;;;Univ Colorado, Leeds Sch Business, Boulder, CO 80309 USAFed Reserve Board, Risk Anal Sect, Washington, DC 20551 USA;;;;2013-03-06;WOS:000314561400009;;

Design/methodology/approach By using a GARCH model with a generalized error distribution (GED), this study specifies that the gold (or silver) return is a function of a set of economic and uncertainty variables, which include volatility from interest rate innovation, a change in economic policy uncertainty (EPU), a change in geopolitical risk (GPR) and volatility due to pandemic diseases, while controlling for stock market returns, inflation rates, economic growth and the Chinese currency value. Findings This study employs monthly data of gold and silver prices over the period from January 2002 to August 2021 to examine hedging behavior. Estimated results show that the gold return is positively correlated to the stock return and a rise in uncertainty from economic policy innovation, geopolitical risk, volatility due to US interest rate innovation as well as COVID-19 infection. This result suggests that gold cannot be used to hedge against a stock market decline, but can be used to hedge against uncertainty in general. However, the silver return only responds positively to a rise in uncertainty from the inflation rate and geopolitical risk. Evidence shows that silver returns are negatively correlated with stock returns, and display hedging characteristics. However, the evidence lacks statistically significance during the COVID-19 period, suggesting that the role of silver as a safe-haven asset against stock market turmoil is weak for this time period. Research limitations/implications More general nonlinear specifications can be developed. The tests may include different measures of uncertainty that interact with each other or with the lagged error terms. An implication of the model is that gold can be used to hedge against a broad range of uncertainties for economic policy change, political risk and/or a pandemic. However, the use of gold as an asset to hedge against a stock downturn in Chinese market should be done with caution. Practical implications This study has important policy implications as regards a choice in assets in formatting a portfolio to hedge against uncertainty. Specifically, this study presents empirical evidence on gold and silver return behavior and finds that gold returns respond positively to heightened uncertainty. Thus, gold is a good asset to hedge against uncertainty arising from policy innovations and infectious disease uncertainty. Social implications This paper provides insightful information on the choice of assets toward hedging against risk in the uncertainty market conditions. It provides information to investors and policy makers to use gold price movements as a signal for detecting the arrival of uncertainty. This study also provides information for demanding a risk premium for infectious disease. Originality/value This study empirically analyzes and verifies the role that gold serves as a safe haven asset to hedge against uncertainty in the Chinese market. This paper contributes to the literature by presenting evidence of risk/uncertainty premiums for holding gold against various sources of uncertainty such as economic policy uncertainty, geopolitical risk and equity market volatility due to US interest rate innovation and/or COVID-19.This study finds evidence that supports the use of a nonlinear specification, which demonstrates the interaction of uncertainty with the lagged change of infectious disease and helps to explain the gold/silver return behavior. Further, evidence shows that the gold return is positively correlated to the stock return. This finding contrasts with evidence in the US market. However, silver returns are negatively correlated with stock returns, but this correlation becomes insignificant during the period of COVID-19.;;;;;;;;;25;0;0;0;0;0;31;;;2044-1398;2044-1401;;;;;;;;;;Drexel Univ, Bennett S LeBow Coll Business, Dept Finance, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA;;;;2022-06-24;WOS:000812022000001;;

Our findings indicate that the long-short equal-weighted and value-weighted portfolios yield significant excess returns. However, the value-weighted excess returns are primarily driven by the predictive power of the lowest decile (sell recommendations). The long-short strategy for the value-weighted portfolios yields a monthly excess return ranging from 1.36% to 1.57%, above the risk-free rate.

A robust scaling method is considered to take into account the sensitiveness of estimates to abnormal data. A genetic algorithm is developed to these purposes. Two examples are presented where models are designed to produce short-term forecasts for the excess returns of the MSCI Europe Energy sector on the MSCI Europe index and a recursive estimation-window is used to shed light on their predictability performances. In the first application the data-set is obtained by a reduction procedure from a very large number of leading macro indicators and financial variables stacked at various lags, while in the second the complete set of 1-month lagged variables is considered.

Utilizing an extensive dataset of Chinese analyst reports and employing a customized BERT deep learning model for Chinese text, the study categorizes the sentiment of these reports as positive, neutral, or negative. The findings highlight the predictive power of this sentiment indicator for stock volatility, excess returns, and trading volume. Specifically, analyst reports with strong positive sentiment are associated with increased excess returns and intraday volatility. Conversely, reports with strong negative sentiment also heighten volatility and trading volume but lead to a decline in future excess returns. Notably, the magnitude of the effect is more pronounced for positive sentiment reports compared to negative ones.

Evidence reveals several key new firm-level determinants, e.g., the volatility operating performance, the size of its accounts payable, pretax income to common equity, total short-term debt, and a few macroeconomic variables such as treasury bill rate, and book-to-market of the DJIA index. These findings have major economic implications.

Our purpose is to shed light on the efficiency of currency markets and how and why it has evolved over this time. For the currencies of emerging economies, our analysis of rates of return on forward contracts finds some evidence of excess-predictability, especially in the earlier parts of the sample period, consistent with the view that this portion of the foreign exchange market has only become efficient in recent times. When we turn our attention to excess-returns computed from spot exchange rates and spot interest rates, however, we find much less predictability. In particular, over our full sample period, we find no evidence of excess-predictability, in contrast with the results reported by Hsu et al. (2016) but in agreement with Kuang et al. (2014). The different predictability of spot excess-returns and rates of return on forward contracts is a manifestation of the widespread violation of covered interest parity which emerged with the onset of the 2008 financial crisis.

The first one is the development of a rigorous rule-based mechanism for identifying the rounding bottoms (also known as saucers) pattern and resistant levels. The design of this model is based solely on principles of technical analysis, and thus making it a proper system for evaluating the efficacy of the aforementioned technical trading patterns. The second aim of this paper is measuring the predictive power of buy-signals generated by these technical patterns. Empirical results obtained from seven US tech stocks indicate that simple resistant levels outperform saucers patterns. Furthermore, positive statistical significant excess returns are being generated only in first sub-periods of examination. These returns decline or even vanish as the experiment proceeds to recent years. Our findings are aligned with the results reported by various former studies. The proposed identification mechanism can be used as a component of an expert system to assist academic community in evaluating trading strategies where technical patterns are embedded.

Furthermore, theoretical models are constructed based on HAR-RV model to analyze the contagion structure between media sentiment and investors' sentiment and its impact on the performance of stock market. Additionally, the reverse silence spiral theory is proposed to analyze the regulatory role of sentiment disagreement in the contagion effects according to the information communication theory. The empirical results demonstrate the following conclusions. (1) The optimism degree of media reports positively affects investors' subjective sentiment and increases their transaction volume. (2) Strengthening investors' attention to corporate-related information is the main path by which media sentiment interferes with investors' sentiment. (3) Media sentiment will indirectly affect the excess return and volatility of stocks through investors' sentiment and their transactions. (4) Media sentiment disagreement has weakened the influence of media sentiment on investors' attention and sentiment. Investors' sentiment disagreement has alleviated its impact on the excess returns and volatility of stocks.;;;;;;;;;3;0;0;0;1;0;3;;;2424-7863;2424-7944;;;;;;;;;;Shanghai Normal Univ, Sch Finance & Business, Shanghai, Peoples R ChinaEast China Normal Univ, Fac Econ & Management, Shanghai, Peoples R China;;;;2023-04-15;WOS:000961108200001;;

This paper presents a novel sparse enhanced indexation model with chance and cardinality constraints. Its goal is to maximize the excess return that can be attained with a high probability, while the model allows a fund manger to limit the number of stocks in the portfolio and specify the maximum tolerable relative market risk. In particular, we model the asset returns as random variables and estimate their probability distributions by the Capital Asset Pricing Model or Fama-French 3-factor model, and measure the relative market risk with the coherent semideviation risk function. We deal with the chance constraint via distributionally robust approach and present a second-order cone programming and a semidefinite programming safe approximation for the model under different sets of potential distribution functions. A hybrid genetic algorithm is applied to solve the NP-hard problem. Numerical tests are conducted on the real data sets from major international stock markets, including USA, UK, Germany and China. The results demonstrate that the proposed model and the method can efficiently solve the enhanced indexation problem and our approach can generally achieve sparse tracking portfolios with good out-of-sample excess returns and high robustness.;;;;;International Workshop on Modern Optimization and Applications (MOA)International Workshop on Modern Optimization and Applications (MOA);JUN 27-29, 2016JUN 27-29, 2016;;Chinese Acad Sci, Acad Math & Syst Sci, Beijing, PEOPLES R CHINAChinese Acad Sci, Acad Math & Syst Sci, Beijing, PEOPLES R CHINA;16;0;0;0;0;0;16;;;0925-5001;1573-2916;;;;;;;;;;Xidian Univ, Sch Econ & Management, Xian 710071, Shaanxi, Peoples R ChinaXi An Jiao Tong Univ, Sch Econ & Finance, Xian 710061, Shaanxi, Peoples R ChinaChinese Acad Sci, Acad Math & Syst Sci, Beijing 100190, Peoples R ChinaBeijing Univ Technol, Dept Informat & Operat Res, Coll Appl Sci, Beijing 100124, Peoples R China;;;;2018-01-24;WOS:000419940800002;;

One candidate explanation is that funds process information about future asset values and use that information to invest in high-valued assets. But formal theories are scarce because information choice models with many assets are difficult to solve as well as difficult to test. This paper tackles both problems by developing a new attention allocation model that uses the state of the business cycle to predict information choices, which in turn, predict observable patterns of portfolio investments and returns. The predictions about fund portfolios' covariance with payoff shocks, cross-fund portfolio and return dispersion, and their excess returns are all supported by the data. These findings offer new evidence that some investment managers have skill and that attention is allocated rationally.;;;;;;;;;250;3;0;0;0;1;441;;;0012-9682;1468-0262;;;;;;;;;;Univ London Imperial Coll Sci Technol & Med, South Kensington Campus, London SW7 2AZ, EnglandNYU, Dept Finance, Stern Sch Business, 44 W 4th St, New York, NY 10012 USANBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USACEPR, London, EnglandNYU, Dept Econ, Stern Sch Business, 44 W 4th St, New York, NY 10012 USA;;;;2016-03-01;WOS:000373024100004;;

To meet this challenge, we propose a novel approach that combines dimensionality reduction, regime-switching models, and forecast combination to predict excess returns on the S&P 500. First, we aggregate the weekly information of 146 popular macroeconomic and financial variables using different principal component analysis techniques. Second, we estimate Markov-switching models with time-varying transition probabilities using the principal components as predictors. Third, we pool the models in forecast clusters to hedge against model risk and to evaluate the usefulness of different specifications. Our weekly forecasts respond to regime changes in a timely manner to participate in recoveries or to prevent losses. This is also reflected in an improvement of risk-adjusted performance measures as compared to several benchmarks. However, when considering stock market returns, our forecasts do not outperform common benchmarks. Nevertheless, they do add statistical and, in particular, economic value during recessions or in declining markets. (c) 2022 International Institute of Forecasters. Published by Elsevier B.V.

The evolving literature on investor attention suggests that higher GSVI can predict higher returns for the first one or two weeks, but with a subsequent price reversal. We use a more recent dataset that covers S&P BSE 500 companies listed on the Indian stock exchange for 2012-2017 and employ the quantile regression approach because it alleviates the statistical problems arising from biased distribution data. The results suggest that a higher GSVI predicts positive and significant returns in the subsequent first and second weeks. Higher quantiles of GSVI experience higher excess returns. The panel cointegration test results support the findings regarding the cointegration of the GSVI and stock returns. Our empirical evidence shows that our model is robust when using a trading strategy based on the Fama-French four-factor model. Thus, the model with GSVI acts as a better predictor of both the direction and magnitude of the excess returns than the model without GSVI.;;;;;;;;;51;0;0;0;3;0;58;;;0275-5319;1878-3384;;;;;;;;;;Deemed Be Univ, IBS, Dept Econ, Hyderabad 501203, Telangana, IndiaIBS, Dept Finance, Hyderabad 501203, Telangana, IndiaUniv Tokyo, Dept Technol Management Innovat, Bunkyo Ku, 7-3-1 Hongo, Tokyo 1138656, Japan;;;;2019-10-22;WOS:000489688700001;;

We also estimate a significant negative market price of correlation risk, which accounts for the cross-section of hedge fund excess returns.

When applied to a portfolio of five stock and bond returns, we find that our method leads to large forecast gains, both in statistical and economic terms.

Hence, it is important to pretest the existence of such serial correlation. Nevertheless, in the presence of embedded endogeneity, which is a common problem in the predictive regression setting, traditional serial correlation tests such as Box-Pierce (BP) and Ljung-Box (LB) tests are found to perform poorly. Motivated by this, we develop a new portmanteau test in this article as a pretest for serial correlation in predictive regression under possible embedded endogeneity. This test is based on the sample splitting idea and the jackknife empirical likelihood method. The asymptotic distribution of the proposed test has been derived, and the Monte Carlo simulations confirm good finite sample performances.

The performance of extreme daily returns is evaluated in terms of their power to predict short- and long-horizon returns on various stock market indices and size portfolios. The paper shows that the speed of mean reversion is significantly higher during the large falls of the market. The parameter estimates indicate a negative and significant relation between the monthly portfolio returns and the extreme daily returns observed over the past one to eight months. Specifically, in a quarter in which the minimum daily return is -2% the expected excess return is 37 basis points higher than in a month in which the minimum return is only -1%. This result holds for the value-weighted and equal-weighted stock market indices and for each of the size decile portfolios. The findings are also robust to different sample periods, different indices, and investment horizons. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V.

The equity premium estimate that emerges from most of this work matches one moment of the data alone: the mean difference between an estimate of the return to holding equity and a risk-free rate. We instead match multiple moments of U.S. market data, exploiting the joint distribution of the dividend yield, return volatility, and realized excess returns, and find that the equity premium lies within 50 basis points of 3.5%, a range much narrower than was achieved in previous studies. Additionally, statistical tests based on the joint distribution of these moments reveal that only those models of the conditional equity premium that embed time variation, breaks, and/or trends are supported by the data. In order to develop the joint distribution of the dividend yield, return volatility, and excess returns, we need a model of price and return fundamentals. We document that even recently developed analytically tractable models that permit autocorrelated dividend growth rates and discount rates impose restrictions that are rejected by the data. We therefore turn to a wider range of models, requiring numerical solution methods and parameter estimation by the simulated method of moments.;;;;;;;;;5;0;0;0;0;0;10;;;0022-1090;1756-6916;;;;;;;;;;Univ British Columbia, Sander Sch Business, Vancouver, BC V6T 1Z2, CanadaYork Univ, Schulich Sch Business, N York, ON M3J 1P3, CanadaUniv Toronto, Rotman Sch Management, Toronto, ON M5S 3E6, Canada;;;;2011-01-25;WOS:000284129700001;;

Thereby, the results provide evidence that Twitter sentiment and media attention ultimately fueled and accelerated the crash dynamics of Silicon Valley Bank.

This paper investigates the contagion from oil prices to Chinese stock sectors by considering differences between extreme positive returns and extreme negative returns. We compute time-varying cut-offs by employing a generalized Pareto distribution (GPD) function to estimate excess returns. We then use a multinomial logit (MNL) model to examine the probability of Chinese stock sector co-exceedances associated with oil price exceedances. Our results indicate that, compared to common domestic factors, the contagion between oil price and stock sectors is relatively weak, but never negligible. We argue that faced with volatile oil prices during turbulent periods, the existence of any contagion weakens the benefits of portfolio diversification related to oil and Chinese stock sector investment. Based on our findings, investors holding a portfolio of oil and Chinese sector stocks should pay special attention to the extreme changes in crude oil prices and adopt hedging measures to protect their portfolio from extreme shocks to oil markets.

The methods used include logistic regressions, regularized logistic regressions and similarity-based classification. I test the methods in a contemporary data set involving data from eleven developed markets. Both statistical and economic significance of the results are considered. As an ensemble, the results seem to indicate that there is some degree of mild predictability in the stock markets. Some of the results obtained are highly significant in the economic sense, featuring annualized excess returns of 3.1% (France), 2.9% (Netherlands) and 0.8% (United States).

Variable selection in such a context is of great importance. In this paper, we explore the pitfalls and possibilities of the LASSO methods in this predictive regression framework. In the presence of stationary, local unit root, and cointegrated predictors, we show that the adaptive LASSO cannot asymptotically eliminate all cointegrating variables with zero regression coefficients. This new finding motivates a novel post-selection adaptive LASSO, which we call the twin adaptive LASSO (TAlasso), to restore variable selection consistency. Accommodating the system of heterogeneous regressors, TAlasso achieves the well-known oracle property. In contrast, conventional LASSO fails to attain coefficient estimation consistency and variable screening in all components simultaneously. We apply these LASSO methods to evaluate the short-and long-horizon predictability of S & P 500 excess returns. (C) 2021 Elsevier B.V.

However, its volatility and brand new trading mode has made it challenging to devising an acceptable automatically-generating strategy. This study proposes a framework for automatic high-frequency bitcoin transactions based on a deep reinforcement learning algorithm - proximal policy optimization (PPO). The framework creatively regards the transaction process as actions, returns as awards and prices as states to align with the idea of reinforcement learning. It compares advanced machine learning-based models for static price predictions including support vector machine (SVM), multi-layer perceptron (MLP), long short-term memory (LSTM), temporal convolutional network (TCN), and Transformer by applying them to the real-time bitcoin price and the experimental results demonstrate that LSTM outperforms. Then an automatically-generating transaction strategy is constructed building on PPO with LSTM as the basis to construct the policy. Extensive empirical studies validate that the proposed method perform superiorly to various common trading strategy benchmarks for a single financial product. The approach is able to trade bitcoins in a simulated environment with synchronous data and obtains a 31.67% more return than that of the best benchmark, improving the benchmark by 12.75%. The proposed framework can earn excess returns through both the period of volatility and surge, which opens the door to research on building a single cryptocurrency trading strategy based on deep learning. Visualizations of trading the process show how the model handles high-frequency transactions to provide inspiration and demonstrate that it can be expanded to other financial products.

The corresponding evidence remains robust to changes in the business cycle, forecasting horizons, and alternative evaluation periods.;;;;;;;;;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;;;1042-444X;1873-1309;;;;;;;;;;Zhe Jiang Univ Finance & Econ, Dept Finance, Hangzhou, Peoples R China;Zhe Jiang Univ Finance & Econ;;;2025-02-16;WOS:001418039700001;;

We adopt the LASSO method to select essential predictors among the variables mentioned in the literature. We show the preeminence of our proposed QHM through the fact that it presents a different degree of financial ratios' effect over various quantile levels. While DHM only confirms the aftermaths of stock return volatilities and total liabilities and the positive effects of stock price, stock excess return, and profitability on businesses, under high quantile levels QHM is able to supplement cash and short-term investment to total assets, market capitalization, and current liabilities ratio into the list of factors that influence a default. More interestingly, cash and short-term investment to total assets and market capitalization switch signs in high quantile levels, showing their different influence on companies with different risk levels. We also discover evidence for the distinction of default probability among different industrial sectors. Lastly, our proposed QHM empirically demonstrates improved out-of-sample forecasting performance.;;;;;;;;;7;0;0;0;0;0;10;;;1062-9408;1879-0860;;;;;;;;;;Feng Chia Univ, Dept Econ, Taichung, TaiwanSan Jose State Univ, Dept Mkt & Decis Sci, San Jose, CA 95192 USAFeng Chia Univ, Dept Stat, Taichung, Taiwan;;;;2018-04-27;WOS:000429499400014;;

In this paper, we discuss the rationale for factor investing based on Musharakah principle. The essential elements or factors of Musharakah principle such as business sector, management capability, profitability growth and capital efficiency are embedded in the Shariah-compliant stock. We then transform these factors into indexation for better analysis and performance measurement.

For online portfolio selection, transaction costs incurred by changes of investment proportions on risky assets have a significant impact on the investment strategy and the return in long-term investment horizon. However, in many online portfolio selection studies, transaction costs are usually neglected in the decision making process. In this paper, we consider an adaptive online portfolio selection problem with transaction costs. We first propose an adaptive online moving average method (AOLMA) to predict the future returns of risky assets by incorporating an adaptive decaying factor into the moving average method, which improves the accuracy of return prediction. The net profit maximization model (NPM) is then constructed where transaction costs are considered in each decision making process. The adaptive online net profit maximization algorithm (AOLNPM) is designed to maximize the cumulative return by integrating AOLMA and NPM together. Numerical experiments show that AOLNPM dominates several state-of-the-art online portfolio selection algorithms in terms of various performance metrics, i.e., cumulative return, mean excess return, Sharpe ratio, Information ratio and Calmar ratio.

These approaches typically explore aggressive strategies to gain excess returns due to the existence of irrational phenomena in financial markets. However, existing aggressive OLPO strategies rarely consider the downside risk and lack effective trend representation, which leads to poor prediction performance and large investment losses in certain market environments. Besides, prediction with a single model is often unstable and sensitive to the noises and outliers, and the subsequent selection of optimal parameters also become obstacles to accurate estimation. To overcome these drawbacks, this paper proposes a novel kernel-based aggregating learning (KAL) system for OLPO. It includes a two-step price prediction scheme to improve the accuracy and robustness of the estimation. Specifically, a component price estimator is built by exploiting additional indicator information and the nonstationary nature of financial time series, and then an aggregating learning method is presented to combine multiple component estimators following different principles. Next, this paper conducts an enhanced tracking system by introducing a kernel-based increasing factor to maximize the future wealth of next period. At last, an online learning algorithm is designed to solve the system objective, which is suitable for large-scale and time-limited situations. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets from diverse real markets show that KAL outperforms other state-of-the-art systems in cumulative wealth and some risk-adjusted metrics. Meanwhile, it can withstand certain transaction costs.;;;;;;;;;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;;;1024-123X;1563-5147;;;;;;;;;;Nanjing Univ Aeronaut & Astronaut, Coll Econ & Management, Nanjing 211106, Peoples R ChinaAnhui Polytech Univ, Coll Management Engn, Wuhu 241000, Peoples R China;;;;2020-03-05;WOS:000514368200006;;

Additionally, economic evaluations demonstrate the superior performance of models incorporating investors' attention to climate change or extreme weather as predictors. While not all exogenous predictors are equally important for volatility forecasts, adopting appropriate variable selection methods to handle different sets of exogenous predictors can lead to better performance than the HAR benchmark. With the inclusion of air pollution or weather factors in the HAR model, a portfolio with an annualized average excess return of 16.2068% or a Sharpe ratio of 10.0431 can be achieved for the wheat futures, respectively.;;;;;;;;;9;0;0;0;0;0;9;;;0270-7314;1096-9934;;;;;;;;;;South China Univ Technol, Sch Business Adm, Guangzhou, Guangdong, Peoples R ChinaGuangdong Univ Foreign Studies, Sch Finance, Guangzhou, Guangdong, Peoples R ChinaSouthern China Inst Fortune Management Res, Guangzhou, Guangdong, Peoples R ChinaInst Financial Openness & Asset Management, Guangzhou, Guangdong, Peoples R ChinaGuangdong Univ Foreign Studies, Sch Finance, Univ Town, Guangzhou 510006, Guangdong, Peoples R China;Southern China Inst Fortune Management ResInst Financial Openness & Asset Management;;;2023-11-05;WOS:001086985200001;;

Empirical results show that the individual sentiment has a significant negative effect on the time-varying risk-return tradeoff across all quantiles, indicating the heterogeneity of the individual sentiment effect. Specifically, the positive individual sentiment weakens the time-varying risk-return tradeoff while the negative individual sentiment enhances it. Besides, there are asymmetric effects of the individual sentiment at quantiles (0.25, 0.75), that is, a negative individual sentiment associated with bad news has a stronger impact than a positive individual sentiment associated with good news. These findings are robust for alternative estimate methods and individual sentiments. However, the study finds that the time-varying riskreturn tradeoff is less sensitive to the market-wide sentiment than to the individual sentiment, indicating that the individual sentiment is more useful and important in determining the stock price and variation.;;;;;;;;;15;2;0;0;1;0;21;;;1059-0560;1873-8036;;;;;;;;;;Jiangnan Univ, Sch Business, Wuxi 214122, Jiangsu, Peoples R China;;;;2021-12-27;WOS:000731079200005;;

We then define a factor model for asset returns, with returns depending on regimes through the factors. The joint distribution of regimes and asset returns is the input to optimal portfolio selection models.

To overcome this challenge, we propose a three-level nested portfolio optimization model with position allocation. Within this model, the inner and middle levels collaboratively determine the optimal portfolio, while the outer level focuses on optimizing the holding proportion of each stock in the optimal portfolio. Compared with existing models with portfolio weights, the proposed model imposes the position allocation constraint that precisely characterizes the limitations on holding each stock. This constraint is crucial for investors to obey securities trading regulations involving position limitations and to mitigate the potential impact of market risks. To address the nonlinear and nonconvex nature of the novel model, we develop an intelligent optimization algorithm by effectively hybridizing the support vector regression and the enhanced grey wolf optimizer. We comprehensively evaluate its performance using eight metrics, including accumulative return, annual return, Sharpe ratio, maximum drawdown, absolute and relative win ratios, predictive precision and accuracy. The experimental results indicate that (i) the proposed model can achieve more excess returns than those stock selection models not considering position allocation, especially for the large-cap stocks; (ii) compared with other state-of-the-art meta-heuristics, the enhanced grey wolf optimizer can yield better portfolio in conjunction with the support vector regression; (iii) in the context of the Chinese A-share stock market, specific financial indicators such as return on equity, inventory turnover rate, net income growth rate, and debt-to-equity ratio should be given greater consideration compared to other financial metrics.";;;;;;;;;1;0;0;0;0;0;1;;;1568-4946;1872-9681;;;;;;;;;;Beihang Univ, Sch Econ & Management, Beijing 100191, Peoples R ChinaBeihang Univ, Minist Educ, Key Lab Complex Syst Anal Management & Decis, Beijing 100191, Peoples R ChinaGuotai Junan Secur Co Ltd, FangZhuang Wealthy Management Ctr, Beijing 100078, Peoples R China;Guotai Junan Secur Co Ltd;;;2024-09-06;WOS:001301728700001;;

In this study, we develop a new forecasting approach referred to as FSPSOSVR, which is able to accurately predict exchange rates by combining particle swarm optimization (PSO), random forest feature selection, and support vector regression (SVR). PSO is used to obtain the optimal SVR parameters for predicting exchange rates. Our analysis involves the monthly exchange rates from January 1971 to December 2017 of seven countries including Australia, Canada, China, the European Union, Japan, Taiwan, and the United Kingdom. The out-of-sample forecast performance of the FSPSOSVR algorithm is compared with six competing forecasting models using the mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) and root mean square error (RMSE), including random walk, exponential smoothing, autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA), seasonal ARIMA, SVR, and PSOSVR. Our empirical results show that the FSPSOSVR algorithm consistently yields excellent predictive accuracy, which compares favorably with competing models for all currencies. These findings suggest that the proposed algorithm is a promising method for the empirical forecasting of exchange rates. Finally, we show the empirical relevance of exchange rate forecasts arising from FSPSOSVR by use of foreign exchange carry trades and find that the proposed trading strategies can deliver positive excess returns of more than 3% per annum for most currencies, except for AUD and NTD.;;;;;;;;;7;0;0;0;0;0;11;;;;2071-1050;;;;;;;;;;Natl Kaohsiung Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Tourism Management, Kaohsiung 824004, TaiwanNatl Kaohsiung Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Business Adm, Kaohsiung 807618, TaiwanNatl Kaohsiung Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Elect Engn, Kaohsiung 807618, TaiwanKaohsiung Med Univ, PhD Program Biomed Engn, Kaohsiung 80708, Taiwan;;;;2021-04-06;WOS:000628603500001;;

This paper employs a design science approach and proposes a new compositemetric, eigen attention centrality (EAC), as a proxy for information flows associated with a node that considers both attention to a node and coattention with other nodes in a network. We apply the EAC metric in the context of financial market where nodes are individual stocks and edges are based on coattention relationships among stocks. Composite information from different channels is used to measure attention and coattention. To evaluate the effectiveness of the EAC metric on predicting outcomes, we conduct an in-depth performance evaluation of the EAC metric by (1) using multiple linear and nonlinear prediction methods and (2) comparing EAC with a benchmark model without EAC and models with a set of alternative network metrics. Our analysis shows that EAC significantly outperforms other measures in predicting the direction and magnitude of abnormal returns of stocks. Besides, our EAC specification has better predictive performance than alternative specifications, and EAC outperforms direct attention in predicting abnormal returns. Using the EAC metric, we derive a stock portfolio and develop a trading strategy that provides significant and positive excess returns. Lastly, we find that composite information has significantly better predictive performance than separate information sources, and such superior performance owes to information from social media instead of traditional media.;;;;;;;;;14;0;0;0;0;0;16;;;1047-7047;1526-5536;;;;;;;;;;Xiamen Univ, Sch Management, Dept Management Sci, Xiamen 361005, Fujian, Peoples R ChinaCity Univ Hong Kong, Coll Business, Dept Informat Syst, Kowloon, Hong Kong, Peoples R ChinaUniv Texas Austin, McCombs Sch Business, Dept Informat Risk & Operat Management, Austin, TX 78712 USAUniv Maryland, Robert H Smith Sch Business, College Pk, MD 20742 USAZhejiang Univ, Sch Management, Dept Data Sci & Management Engn, Hangzhou 310058, Peoples R ChinaCtr Res Zhejiang Digital Dev & Governance, Hangzhou 310058, Peoples R China;Ctr Res Zhejiang Digital Dev & Governance;;;2021-11-02;WOS:000708991000001;;

We use this approach for real one-minute high frequency data of the most traded currency pairs worldwide: EUR/USD, USD/JPY, GBP/USD, AUD/USD, USD/CHF, and USD/CAD. The STGP performance is compared with that of parametric and non-parametric models and validated by two formal empirical tests. We perform in-sample and out-of-sample comparisons between all models on the basis of forecast performance and investment return. Furthermore, our paper shows the relative strength of these models with respect to the actual trading profit generated by their forecasts. Empirical experiments suggest that the STGP forecasting technique significantly outperforms the traditional econometric models. We find evidence that the excess returns are both statistically and economically significant, even when appropriate transaction costs are taken into account. We also find evidence that HFT has a beneficial role in the price discovery process. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

The index is extracted using principal component analysis (PCA), but the results are similar by using the equal-weighted average method. Compared with 14 traditional macroeconomic predictors, CCA performs the best and provides complementary information when added into bivariate and multivariate macro predictive models. When further considering the effect of CCA's forecasting power over different periods, strong evidence is shown that this outperformance is especially prominent in economic depressions and down market conditions. From the asset allocation perspective, CCA can provide a mean-variance investor with significant economic gains under alternative risk aversions.

This paper presents a new framework for learning textual data based on the factor augmentation model and sparsity regularization, called the factor -augmented regularized model for prediction (FarmPredict), to let machines learn financial returns directly from news. FarmPredict allows the model itself to extract information directly from articles without predefined information, such as dictionaries or pretrained models as in most studies. Using unsupervised learned factors to augment the predictors would benefit our method with a doublerobust feature: that the machine would learn to balance between individual words or text factors/topics. It also avoids the information loss of factor regression in dimensionality reduction. We apply our model to the Chinese stock market with a large proportion of retail investors by using Chinese news data to predict financial returns. We show that positive sentiments scored by our FarmPredict approach from news generate on average 83 basic points (bps) stock daily excess returns, and negative news has an adverse impact of 26 bps on the days of news announcements, where both effects can last for a few days. This asymmetric effect aligns well with the short -sale constraints in the Chinese equity market. The result shows that the machine -learned prediction does provide sizeable predictive power with an annualized return of 54% at most with a simple investment strategy. Compared with other statistical and machine learning methods, FarmPredict significantly outperforms them on model prediction and portfolio performance. Our study demonstrates the of machines to learn text data.;;;;;;;;;7;0;0;0;0;0;7;;;0025-1909;1526-5501;;;;;;;;;;Fudan Univ, Inst Big Data, Shanghai 200433, Peoples R ChinaFudan Univ, MOE Lab Natl Dev & Intelligent Governance, Shanghai 200433, Peoples R ChinaCapital Univ Econ & Business, Int Sch Econ & Management, Beijing 100070, Peoples R ChinaPrinceton Univ, Dept Operat Res & Financial Engn, Princeton, NJ 08544 USAFudan Univ, Sch Data Sci, Shanghai 200433, Peoples R China;;;;2024-04-10;WOS:001187890500001;;

The strategy involves two steps. First, an accounting-based probabilistic prediction model of changes in the medium-term book return on owners' equity (ROE) is estimated. Second, market expectations of changes in medium-term ROE are assessed through observed stock prices and the residual income valuation model. Stock market positions over 36-month holding periods are taken when the accounting-based predictions of ROE and the market expectations differ. Over the period 1983-2003, the investment strategy generated values of Jensen's alpha corresponding to an average monthly excess return for a hedge position of up to 0.8% for a sample of manufacturing companies. In the main this hedge return was caused by strong positive returns to the long positions, and additional analyses show that the returns appear to have been affected by a positive market sentiment bias (i.e., positive ROE surprises being associated with stronger price reactions than negative ROE surprises) making out-of-sample inferences somewhat dubious. Furthermore, most of the investment returns accrued over holding periods up to around 1995, with no indications of market mispricing over the last third (1995-2003) of the investment period. The empirical results are consistent with market investors having become more sophisticated in their use of publicly available accounting information over time.;;;;;;;;;8;0;0;0;0;1;8;;;0001-3072;;;;;;;;;;;Stockholm Sch Econ, Ctr Financial Anal & Managerial Econ Accounting, Stockholm, Sweden;;;;2010-12-01;WOS:000284613600002;;

The current consensus is that most savers should invest in mutual funds or ETFs that are (i) well-diversified, (ii) low-cost, and (iii) expose their portfolios to age-appropriate stock market risk. The law governing trustees, investment advisers, broker-dealers, 401(k) plan managers, and other investment fiduciaries has evolved to push them gently toward this consensus. But these laws still provide broad scope for fiduciaries to recommend that clients invest instead in specific assets that they believe will produce alpha by outperforming the market. Seeking alpha comes at a cost, however, in giving up some of the benefits of the well-diversified, low-cost, appropriate-risk baseline. Too little attention has been given in fiduciary law to this tradeoff and, thus, to when seeking alpha is prudent and beneficial for savers, and when it is not.This Article begins to fill that gap by making two contributions. First, we provide the first benchmark estimates of how much alpha is required before ordinary investors would be better off departing from the consensus. For example, we estimate that a person of average risk aversion would annually need to beat the market by (i.e., obtain alpha of) between 6% and 15% before being willing to entirely forego the benefits of diversification and hold an individual stock (and that during a financial crisis such a person would need an annual alpha between 9% and 18%). Second, we consider the implications of our results for the various branches of law governing investment fiduciaries. We propose generally that fiduciaries should prudently weigh these alpha tradeoffs, and then should explain them to their clients before recommending (or executing) investments that deviate from the low-cost, well-diversified, age-appropriate exposure standard. We argue that through new technology, this kind of information can be given to retirement savers and others at quite low cost. Our results also have a variety of more specific applications. For example, our work shows that the value of diversification increases during periods of market upheaval, and therefore the duty of trustees to diversify personal trusts and employee retirement plans should likewise strengthen during such periods.;;;;;;;;;7;0;0;0;0;0;7;;;0040-4411;;;;;;;;;;;Yale Law Sch, New Haven, CT 06511 USAUniv Michigan, Sch Law, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA;;;;2019-03-12;WOS:000460197800001;;

Firstly, we show that the sovereign default risk, which is taken on by investing in high-yield currencies, may increase the magnitude of the gains during the boom periods and the losses during crises. We empirically test for this hypothesis on a sample of 18 emerging currencies over the period from June 2005 to September 2010, the default risk being proxied by the sovereign credit default swap spread. Relying on smooth transition regression (STR) models, we show that default risk contributes to the carry-trade gains during booms, and worsens the losses during busts. Secondly, we turn to the Fama regression linking the exchange-rate depreciation to the interest-rate differential. We propose a nonlinear estimation of this equation, explaining the puzzling evolution of its coefficient by the change in the market volatility along the financial cycle. Then, we introduce the default risk into this equation and show that the forward bias, usually evidenced by a coefficient smaller than unity in this regression, is somewhat alleviated, as the default risk is significant to explain the exchange-rate change.

This paper considers both quantitative and qualitative data to construct a more comprehensive model than that in the past. Based on the optimized database, we present a combinational model named RF-SA, which is composed of random forest and sentiment analysis model. First of all, this paper uses the SBS algorithm to select the characteristics of stock transaction historical data, optimizes the prediction database, reduces data redundancy, and improves the accuracy of the model. Secondly, we analyze the characteristics of the Chinese stock market and study the advantages and disadvantages of many data mining algorithms, and select random forest model, the most suitable model, to build the first step of stock selection model. Then, through the analysis of public opinion, the confidence index of the stockholders is calculated; on this basis, the results of the RF model and the confidence index are combined to make a second choice for the stock, and the quantitative investment portfolio is obtained, and excess returns can be obtained.

(2016) to predict economic variables out-of-sample. Using simple predictive regressions a la Goyal and Welch (2008), we evaluate the predictive power afforded by various nonlinear transformations of the U.S. EPU measure suggested in Baker et al. (2016) to predict excess returns on the S&P 500 index one-month ahead. Using data from 1985 m1 through 2020 m12, we find that not all EPU movements are equally important for obtaining point prediction improvements relative to the historical average benchmark at the population level. Particularly, we document that the one-year net EPU increase, defined as EPU increases beyond the peak over the last year, otherwise zero delivers the most consistent pattern of prediction improvements relative to the benchmark. Conversely, other nonlinear specifications as well as the linear models using log-EPU and the first difference of log-EPU do not deliver the same performance. Overall, this study documents that the predictive impact of the U.S. EPU index suggested in Baker et al. (2016) on equity premium is nonlinear in that EPU increases matter only to the extent that they exceed the maximum value over the last twelve months. In other words, there is evidence of threshold nonlinearity. The statistical predictive power afforded by the one-year net EPU increase also translates into economic gains.;;;;;;;;;4;0;0;0;0;0;4;;;1057-5219;1873-8079;;;;;;;;;;Danske Bank, Laksegade 8, DK-1063 Copenhagen K, DenmarkAarhus Univ, CREATES, Aarhus, Denmark;Danske Bank;;;2021-09-23;WOS:000694972000010;;

This model's significant advantage is its intuitive and reactive design that incorporates the latest asset return regimes to quantitatively solve managers' question: how certain should one be that a given investment view is occurring? First, we describe a framework for multi-period portfolio allocation formulated as a convex optimization problem that trades off expected return, risk and transaction costs. Using a framework borrowed from model predictive control introduced by Boyd et al., we employ optimization to plan a sequence of trades using forecasts of future quantities, only the first set being executed. Multi-period trading lends itself to dynamic readjustment of the portfolio when gaining new information. Second, we use the Black-Litterman model to combine investment views specified in a simple linear combination based format with the market portfolio. A data-driven method to adjust the confidence in the manager's views by comparing them to dynamically updated regime-switching forecasts is proposed. Our contribution is to incorporate both multi-period trading and interpretable investment views into one framework and offer a novel method of using regime-switching to determine each view's confidence. This method replaces portfolio managers' need to provide estimated confidence levels for their views, substituting them with a dynamic quantitative approach. The framework is reactive, tractable and tested on 15 years of daily historical data. In a numerical example, this method's benefits are found to deliver higher excess returns for the same degree of risk in both the case when an investment view proves to be correct, but, more notably, also the case when a view proves to be incorrect. To facilitate ease of use and future research, we also developed an open-source software library that replicates our results.;;;;;;;;;12;0;0;0;0;0;12;;;1911-8066;1911-8074;;;;;;;;;;Univ Toronto, Dept Mech & Ind Engn, 5 Kings Coll Rd, Toronto, ON M5S 3G8, Canada;;;;2021-02-09;WOS:000610326500001;;

In search of accurate PD prediction, we propose a flexible yet easy-to-interpret default-prediction single-index hazard model (DSI). By applying it to a comprehensive U.S. corporate bankruptcy database we constructed, we discover an interesting V-shaped relationship, indicating a violation of the common linear hazard specification. Most importantly, the single-index hazard model passes the Hosmer-Lemeshow goodness-of-fit calibration test while neither does a state-of-the-art linear hazard model in finance nor a parametric class of Box-Cox transformation survival models. In an economic value analysis, we find that this may translate to as much as three times of profit compared to the linear hazard model. In model estimation, we adopt a penalized-spline approximation for the unknown function and propose an efficient algorithm. With a diverging number of spline knots, we establish consistency and asymptotic theories for the penalized-spline likelihood estimators. Furthermore, we reexamine the distress risk anomaly, that is, higher financially distressed stocks deliver anomalously lower excess returns.

J;이재웅;;;;;;;;;;Shareholder Value Effects of Joint Venture Companies in the Amsterdam Stock Exchange;;;;;;;;The Journal of Eurasian Studies;유라시아연구;;;6;3;;;89;102;;;;;;;;;;;research-article;2009;2009;Amsterdam Stock Exchange is one of the oldest stock exchange. where the East India Stockholding Company was established back in 15th century under Pax Hollandia. Presently, Korea-European Union Free Trade negotiation has been taken place. In case when Korean listed company were made a joint venture agreement with Dutch company and were supposed to be listed in Amsterdam Stock Exchange, the joint venture company is regarded as listed in another EU nation's stock exchange, namely DAX in Germany, etc. Therefore, it is not only beneficial to Korean joint venture company but also Dutch parent company listed in Amsterdam Stock Exchange. This was ‘reason d'etre' of writing this paper.An investigation on the shareholder value effects of 233 joint venture announcement by Dutch public companies was made in the period of 1987-1998. The study focuses on joint ventures in which the consequences for the shareholders of parents companies are key points. This paper contains the study on the joint venture strategy which has an effect upon the shareholder value with the help of data acquired in the Netherlands.Event study was performed in accordance with “Fama Methodology. The stock price movement was observed on the basis of public announcement date, which was obtained from Netherlands “Het Finnancieele Dagblad newspaper. It should be noted that banking and finance industry were excluded from data. The analysis of the value effect of joint ventures includes only the anomalous part of the market reaction in respect to the parent company share price. The expected returns on the relevant days were estimated by means of the market model approach. The abnormal return(ARit) of a share at time t is calculated as follows:ARit=Rit-(ai+biRmt)where: Rit = the effective return of share i at time t Rmt = the market return at time t ai = constant term of share i bi = systematic risk of share i ai+biRmt = the expected return on share i according the market model The Decision-Making of Joint Venture is follows: 1)Strategic Content: According to Koh and Venkatraman(1991), Das, Sen and Sengupta(1998), the motives of joint venture decision-making stem from both market and technology development. 2)Strategic Context: It defines the decision-making parameters of environment. Important elements are partner selection, the nationalities and associated cultural differences. Mohanram and Nanda(1998) and Joh and Vendatraman(1991) found that smaller companies gain more excess returns if they enter into alliance with a large partner. 3)Strategic Control: It is the extent to which an enterprise can exert influence on the further development of the joint venture. The ownership structure is as clear manifestation of the degree of influence that a company can exert on the joint venture. Bleek and Ernst(19930 argue that an equal balance of power makes it easier to manage a joint venture and consequently increases the possibility of success. In contrast, Koh and Venkatraman(1991) found that one party having more power within and alliance had a positive effect. Event Study show that, on average, joint venture announcements have positive impact on the price of the companies involved. This results revealed that positive market reactions were found with significance level of 0.01 for both performance criteria(CAR and SCAR). The CAR is equal to 0.40%. The reaction to joint ventures were both strongly positive(1,77% on average) and negative(-1.34% on average). Joint venture listed companies in the Amsterdam Stock Exchange during the period of 1987～1988 generated shareholder value effect. Clearly, this results eloquently has shown the negative relationship of Berg and Friedman's(1977) paper.;;;;;;;;;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;;;1738-3382;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;2009-01-01;KJD:ART001414416;;

Brand alliances, whereby two or more brands are jointly presented to the consumer, have been investigated extensively. The importance of brand alliances is emphasized by two factors: (1) brands are considered critical elements in business-to-business marketing settings; and (2) firms use brand alliances due to the trading costs and investment necessary to buy brands, the increasingly higher costs of launching a new brand onto the market, the high failure rates in new brand launches and brand extensions, the competitive pressures around product launches and diffusion, and the limitations imposed on the extension of a brand by its own identity. Consequently, brand alliances have exploded over recent years. As indicated later, by accomplishing the purpose of this research we fill a gap in the literature as most of the research on brand alliances revolves around consumers' perspective.Methodology/Approach: The methodology followed is based on the event study method. First, the event study estimates the excess returns of share prices generated by events that were unanticipated by the market. To this end, we estimate the market model and the subsequent abnormal returns. To examine the impact of the publication of a brand alliance announcement on the share prices of the company, we use the cumulative abnormal returns calculated over k days of the event window for 55 announcements. In the second step, we analyze the returns of the different brand alliances. In particular, the abnormal returns are used as dependent variable in a regression analysis, wherein the central explanatory variable is brand alliance type (co-branding vs joint promotion). Finally, the third stage of the methodology analyzes the change in the variance of returns between the periods before and after the brand alliance announcements.Findings: The results show that brand alliance announcements generate positive abnormal returns, which support the hypothesis that brand alliance announcements are positively related to company stock returns. In particular, we observe that the reactions to brand alliances are spread over the event window. In fact, the window (-5,+5) produces returns that stand at 1.6%, which is the greatest abnormal return over the five days around the publication date. The economic impact of a cumulative return of 1.6% in eleven days is tantamount to annual returns of 69.33%. Considering that the average market value of the sample is euro17,494 million, it represents an increase of euro279 million for the sample stocks on the period (-5,+5). The regression analysis shows that the coefficients of the variable co-branding are positive and significant, which supports the hypothesis that co-branding presents higher abnormal returns than joint promotion. However, no differential effect are found between B to B versus B to C paradigms. The results obtained present an increase in the variance of the share prices after the alliance announcement date, which supports the hypothesis that the variance of the company stock returns is positively associated to announcements of brand alliances.Research Implications: The key implication of the measurement of the market value of brand alliances is that research should be reoriented toward a better understanding of the role of marketing in the value creation of a company. Instead of just concentrating on marketing research into consumer behavior, more emphasis should be given to the core company processes that create shareholder value.Practical Implications: The managerial implications of the specific results obtained are the following: the result that companies increase their market value when they implement brand alliance strategies, leads to a better ken of the way alliance activities can be managed when dealing with other organizations. In this way, finding a partner to form a brand alliance with could be a useful objective in terms of firm performance. Moreover, the results show that co-branding presents higher abnormal returns than joint promotion, which suggests that co-branding is the most valuable strategic decision (or long-term decision) for companies, as it implies the simultaneous participation of two or more brands in a single product. In this way, deciding on whether a short- or long-term branding strategy is pursued turns to be fundamental.Originality/Value/Contribution of the paper: The literature has analyzed the consequences of brand alliance, which looks at each partner's brand attitude after the alliance, the brand equity of the constituent brands after the alliance, and the impact of the allied brand on the evaluation of the host brand. These studies have focused on the area of consumer behavior; that is, by measuring consumers ' attitudes and evaluation. Still, the measurement of dimensions reflecting the other side of the relationship, i.e. the firm, via brand image and equity is critical. Nevertheless, the examination of the impact of brand alliances on the partner company performance and risk has received little attention, despite the fact that brand perceptions of companies' products spill over to investment decisions in the market for companies' stock.";;;;;;;;;3;0;0;0;0;0;5;;;1051-712X;1547-0628;;;;;;;;;;Univ Alicante, Dept Mkt, Fac Econ, Alicante, SpainVirginia Tech, Pamplin Coll Business, Blacksburg, VA 24061 USA;;;;2021-06-04;WOS:000651613900001;;

The nonlinear multivariate dynamic factor model takes into account not only the popular slope, but also information extracted from the level and curvature of the yield curve, and from macroeconomic variables. We investigate the interrelationship between the phases of cyclical fluctuations in yield curve components and the phases of the business cycle. The results indicate a strong interrelationship between the yield curve and the economy. The proposed model has substantial incremental predictive value relative to alternative specifications.

More specifically, within a Machine Learning framework, we use data from a variety of short (treasury bills) and long term interest rates (bonds) for the period from 1976:Q3 to 2011:Q4 in conjunction with the real GDP for the same period, to create a model that can successfully forecast output fluctuations (inflation and output gaps) around its long-run trend. We focus our attention in correctly forecasting the instances of output gaps referred for the purposes of our analysis here as recessions. In this effort, we applied a Support Vector Machines technique for classification. The results show that we can achieve an overall forecasting accuracy of 66.7 and 100 % accuracy in forecasting recessions.

Using linear and non-linear (parametric quantile) causality tests on daily data from 1986 to February 2020, our findings confirm that changes in the yield spread not only correlate with, but also drive the returns on crude oil, heating oil and natural gas in the short run. This short-run relationship is relatively absent from 1986 to 2003. However, since 2004, the relationship has remained quite strong, confirming that these products have been financialized.

We then apply a broad class of copula functions for modeling dependence in factors spanning the yield curve. Our sample of monthly yields in the 1982-2001 period provides evidence of upper tail dependence in yield innovations; i.e., large positive interest rate shocks tend to occur under increased dependence. In contrast, the best-fitting copula model coincides with zero lower tail dependence. This asymmetry has substantial risk management implications. We give an example in estimating bond portfolio loss quantiles and report the biases which result from an application of the normal dependence model. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V.

Multi-factor models are necessary to characterize the changing shape of the yield curve over time, and the statistical tests support the case for two and three factor models.

The GSG hypothesis argues that the surge in capital inflows from emerging market economies to the United States led to significant declines in long-term interest rates in the United States and other industrial economies. In turn, these lower interest rates, when combined with both innovations and deficiencies of the U.S. credit market, are believed to have contributed to the U.S. housing bubble and to the buildup in financial vulnerabilities that led to the financial crisis. Because the GSG countries for the most part restricted their U.S. purchases to Treasuries and Agency debt, their provision of savings to ultimately risky subprime mortgage borrowers was necessarily indirect, pushing down yields on safe assets and increasing the appetite for alternative investments on the part of other investors. Foreign acquisitions of private-label ABS, primarily by Europeans, provided credit more directly and, by adding to domestic demand for these securities, contributed to the decline in their spreads over Treasury yields. Through a combination of empirical estimation and model simulation, we verify that both GSG inflows into Treasuries and Agencies, as well as European acquisitions of ABS, played a role in contributing to downward pressures on U.S. interest rates.

In this context, this paper aims to investigate the connectedness between the two pioneering bond market classes that are conventional and treasury, with the green bonds market.Design/methodology/approachIn their forecasting target, authors use a Support Vector Regression model on daily S&P 500 Green, Conventional and Treasury Bond Indexes for a year from 2012 to 2022.FindingsAuthors argue that conventional bonds could better explain and predict green bonds than treasury bonds for the three studied sub-periods (pre-crisis period, Covid-19 crisis and Covid-19-Russian-Ukrainian crisis period). Furthermore, conventional and treasury bonds lose their forecasting power in crisis framework due to enhancements in market connectedness relationships. This effect makes spillovers in bond markets more sensitive to crisis and less predictable. Furthermore, this research paper indicates that even if the indicators of the COVID-19 crisis have stagnated and the markets have adapted to this rather harsh economic framework, the forecast errors persist higher than in the pre-crisis phase due to the Russian-Ukrainian crisis effect not yet addressed by the literature.Originality/valueThis study has several implications for the field of green bond forecasting. It not only illuminates the market participants to the best market forecasters, but it also contributes to the literature by proposing an unadvanced investigation of green bonds forecasting in Crisis periods that could help market participants and market policymakers to anticipate market evolutions and adapt their strategies to period specificities.;;;;;;;;;1;0;0;0;0;0;1;;;0144-3585;;;;;;;;;;;Univ Monastir, Fac Econ Sci & Management, Mahdia, TunisiaHigher Inst Management Tunis, BESTMOD Lab Res, Ariana, TunisiaUniv Tunis, Higher Inst Management, Tunis, TunisiaUniv Sousse, Higher Inst Finance & Taxat, Sousse, TunisiaTunis El Manar Univ, Fac Econ Sci & Management Tunis, LAb Res Appl Microecon LARMA, Tunis, Tunisia;Higher Inst Management Tunis;;;2024-06-08;WOS:001237453900001;;

In terms of the distributional predictability of fintech, Bitcoin, and AI in relation to the traditional markets, Islamic stocks, clean energy stocks, and sustainable investments, we find strong evidence of causal asymmetry across quantiles and strong variations across markets. Likewise, findings in terms of directional predictability between the returns of fintech, Bitcoin, and AI and various markets infer that Islamic stocks act as a good hedge against Bitcoin.

Our work is based on the heterogeneous autoregressive (HAR) framework. Empirical results show that the volatility of treasury bond contracts with longer maturities (especially 10 years) has the best effect on predicting the Chinese stock market volatility, both in sample and out of sample. Two machine learning methods, the scaled principal component analysis (SPCA) and the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (lasso), are also more effective than the HAR benchmark model's prediction.

(2014) to investigate the relationship between the treasury yield spread and economic policy uncertainty (EPU) in Japan. This model helps us to explore the short- and long-run asymmetric reactions of explained variables through positive and negative partial sum decompositions of changes in the explanatory variable(s). In our research, the testing of the NARDL specification reveals the existence of a significant long-run asymmetric equilibrium between the yield spread and EPU in Japan. On the other hand, we find a significant positive nexus between the treasury yield spread and EPU reduction in the long run. We speculate that because of low inflation, a poor economic outlook and the low interest rate environment since 1990, financial agents are markedly sensitive to negative shocks resulting from EPU. This means that when facing a good economy, bond agents are quick to sell, especially with higher-risk long-term interest rate bonds. Meanwhile, because the Bank of Japan announced the Stock Purchasing Plan in October 2002 and from the point view of portfolio management, while the influence of a positive economic outlook dominates the negative outlook, flight from quality has no role in asset portfolio adjustment. The empirical implications are that the long history of unconventional monetary policy supports the demand for both bonds and stock markets. When taking the stock market into consideration, the correlations between the yield spread, EPU and stock market capture the full wealth effects of the low interest rate environment in Japan.;;;;;;;;;8;0;0;0;2;0;8;;;;2071-1050;;;;;;;;;;Providence Univ, Finance Fac, Taichung 43301, TaiwanTamkang Univ, Dept Banking & Finance, New Taipei 25137, TaiwanFeng Chia Univ, Dept Finance, Taichung 40724, Taiwan;;;;2020-07-07;WOS:000543421400360;;

This study uses annual data for the study period 1972 to 2012, a time period that includes quantitative easing' monetary policies by the Federal Reserve. Two-stage least squares estimations reveal that the federal budget deficit, expressed as a per cent of GDP, exercised a positive and statistically significant impact on the ex post real interest rate yields on both 3-year and 7-year Treasury notes, even after allowing for quantitative easing and other factors.

Of considerable current interest are models of the yield curve in which a collection of observed and latent factors determine the market price of factor risks, the stochastic discount factor, and the arbitrage-free bond prices. The model is particularly interesting from a statistical perspective, because the yields are complicated nonlinear functions of the underlying parameters (e.g., those appearing in the evolution dynamics of the factors and those appearing in the model of the factor risks). This nonlinearity tends to produce a likelihood function that is multimodal. In this article we revisit the question of how such models should be fit from the Bayesian viewpoint. Key aspects of the inferential framework include (a) a prior on the parameters of the model that is motivated by economic considerations, in particular, those involving the slope of the implied yield curve; (b) posterior simulation of the parameters in ways to improve the efficiency of the MCMC output, for example, through sampling of the parameters marginalized over the factors and tailoring of the proposal densities in the Metropolis-Hastings steps using information about the mode and curvature of the current target based on the output of a simulating annealing algorithm; and (c) measures to mitigate numerical instabilities in the fitting through reparameterizations and square root filtering recursions. We apply the techniques to explain the monthly yields on nine U.S. Treasury Bills (with maturities ranging from 1 month to 120 months) over the period January 1986-December 2005. The model contains three factors, one latent and two observed. We also consider the problem of predicting the nine yields for each month of 2006. We show that the (multi-step-ahead) prediction regions properly bracket the actual yields in those months, thus highlighting the practical value of the fitted model.";;;;;;;;;44;0;0;0;0;0;58;;;0162-1459;1537-274X;;;;;;;;;;Washington Univ, John M Olin Sch Business, St Louis, MO 63130 USAFed Reserve Bank Richmond, Charlotte Branch, Charlotte, NC 28230 USA;;;;2009-12-01;WOS:000273995500005;;

In this paper we evaluate nonlinear machine learning and econometric methodologies in forecasting US inflation based on autoregressive and structural models of the term structure. We employ two nonlinear methodologies: the econometric least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) and the machine-learning support vector regression (SVR) method. The SVR has never been used before in inflation forecasting considering the term spread as a regressor. In doing so, we use a long monthly dataset spanning the period 1871:1-2015:3 that covers the entire history of inflation in the US economy. For comparison purposes we also use ordinary least squares regression models as a benchmark. In order to evaluate the contribution of the term spread in inflation forecasting in different time periods, we measure the out-of-sample forecasting performance of all models using rolling window regressions. Considering various forecasting horizons, the empirical evidence suggests that the structural models do not outperform the autoregressive ones, regardless of the model's method. Thus we conclude that the term spread models are not more accurate than autoregressive models in inflation forecasting.

A panel regression estimation of eight Asian countries for 1998-2004 confirms the striking persistency of the portfolio weight of US Treasury securities. It also reveals, without a surprise, that the traditionally strong trade link with US as well as exchange rate regime and volatility of local currency bond index explain observed overinvestment in US Treasury securities deviating from what can be warranted by the market share of the US Treasury securities. What is interesting, however, is the estimated regime switches as found when examined with a threshold estimation (Hansen, 1999). We find three thresholds which divide the sample into four regimes a decreasing persistency as intraregional trade link becomes tighter. J. Japanese Int. Economies xxx (xx) (2011) xxx-xxx.

Cross-quantilogram analysis reveals a nonlinear dependency across adjacent periods, with stronger connectedness observed in the tail distribution than in the middle. Additionally, the functional quantile autoregression model confirms the spread's nonlinear and asymmetric nature from a distributional perspective. Specifically, higher quantiles of the previous spread exert a stronger influence on the current spread, indicating a positive persistence mechanism. Conversely, lower quantiles of the previous spread negatively affect the higher quantiles of the current spread. These findings suggest that bullish market conditions tend to sustain themselves, whereas bearish conditions hinder upward momentum, underscoring the need for quantile-specific policy interventions.;;;;;;;;;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;;;1544-6123;1544-6131;;;;;;;;;;Shandong Univ, Ctr Econ Res, Jinan, Peoples R China;;;;2025-04-05;WOS:001456887500001;;

A new class of stochastic volatility models with asymmetric drift and nonlinear asymmetric diffusion process is introduced in discrete time and tested against the popular continuous time and symmetric and asymmetric GARCH models. The existing models are rejected in favor of the newly proposed models because of the asymmetric drift of the short rate, and the presence of nonlinearity, asymmetry, GARCH, and level effects in its volatility.

We show that a simple self-consistent estimator can be constructed using the eigenvalue decomposition of a regression estimator. The remaining parameters of the model follow analytically. Estimates from this model are virtually indistinguishable from that of the ML estimator. We apply the method to estimate various models of U.S. Treasury yields.

FGD can improve the accuracy of some reasonable starting estimates obtained using classical short rate models introduced in the literature. It exploits the predictive information of an enlarged set of variables, including yields at other maturities, time, and macroeconomic indicators. Fitting this methodology to the time series of monthly US 3-month Treasury bill rates, we find that the drift dynamics react mostly in a nonlinear way to changes in macroeconomic variables, whereas volatility dynamics are subjected to time-dependent regime-switches. Finally we show the superior performance of the final predictions obtained by applying FGD in a forecasting exercise.;;;;;;;;;1;0;0;0;0;0;1;;;0927-7099;1572-9974;;;;;;;;;;Univ St Gallen, Inst Math & Stat, CH-9000 St Gallen, Switzerland;;;;2012-04-04;WOS:000301594500005;;

This study aims to apply Monte Carlo simulation to solve three classic probabilistic paradoxes and discuss their implementation in corporate financial management. The article presents Monte Carlo simulation as an advanced tool for risk management in financial management processes. This method allows for a comprehensive risk analysis of financial forecasts, making it possible to assess potential errors in cash flow forecasts and predict the value of corporate treasury growth under various future scenarios. In the investment decision-making process, Monte Carlo simulation supports the evaluation of the effectiveness of financial projects by calculating the expected net value and identifying the risks associated with investments, allowing more informed decisions to be made in project implementation. The method is used in reducing cash flow volatility, which contributes to lowering the cost of capital and increasing the value of a company. Simulation also enables more accurate liquidity planning, including forecasting cash availability and determining appropriate financial reserves based on probability distributions. Monte Carlo also supports the management of credit and interest rate risk, enabling the simulation of the impact of various economic scenarios on a company's financial obligations. In the context of strategic planning, the method is an extension of decision tree analysis, where subsequent decisions are made based on the results of earlier ones. Creating probabilistic models based on Monte Carlo simulations makes it possible to take into account random variables and their impact on key financial management indicators, such as free cash flow (FCF). Compared to traditional methods, Monte Carlo simulation offers a more detailed and precise approach to risk analysis and decision-making, providing companies with vital information for financial management under uncertainty. This article emphasizes that the use of Monte Carlo simulation in financial management not only enhances the effectiveness of risk management, but also supports the long-term growth of corporate value. The entire process of financial management is able to move into the future based on predicting future free cash flows discounted at the cost of capital. We used both numerical and analytical methods to solve veridical paradoxes. Veridical paradoxes are a type of paradox in which the result of the analysis is counterintuitive, but turns out to be true after careful examination. This means that although the initial reasoning may lead to a wrong conclusion, a correct mathematical or logical analysis confirms the correctness of the results. An example is Monty Hall's problem, where the intuitive answer suggests an equal probability of success, while probabilistic analysis shows that changing the decision increases the chances of winning. We used Monte Carlo simulation as the numerical method. The following analytical methods were used: conditional probability, Bayes' rule and Bayes' rule with multiple conditions. We solved truth-type paradoxes and discovered why the Monty Hall problem was so widely discussed in the 1990s. We differentiated Monty Hall problems using different numbers of doors and prizes.;;;;;;;;;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;;;2227-7072;;;;;;;;;;;Wroclaw Univ Econ & Business, Fac Management, Komandorska 118, PL-53345 Wroclaw, Poland;;;;2025-06-29;WOS:001515889200001;;

The assets include S&P 500 Futures, Gold Futures, US 10Y Treasury Bond Futures, and a risk-free investment. The study considers 1-week, 4-week, and 12-week forward return periods. The analysis assesses model accuracy and portfolio performance using data spanning two decades. ML-based portfolios modestly outperform an equal-weighted benchmark in terms of risk-adjusted metrics over longer horizons, even though the differences are generally insignificant. However, the study emphasizes the importance of considering diverse economic cycles to understand asset behaviour comprehensively. Nevertheless, the study did not find significant evidence that combining machine learning prediction with dynamic asset allocation can outperform passive portfolio investment. The study underscores the potential of non-linear models in short-term trading but also notes limitations in adaptiveness, threshold design, and model generalization under atypical conditions.;;;;;;;;;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;;;0003-6846;1466-4283;;;;;;;;;;Yuan Ze Univ, Coll Management, 135 Yuan Tung Rd, Taoyuan 320, Taiwan;;;;2025-07-13;WOS:001524268000001;;

BTC perpetual futures are derivative contracts, which depend upon the underlying BTC SPOT (current) price. Pricing perpetual futures fairly is hard, using traditional arbitrage arguments, because of the volatile nature of the so called funding rate, which is used as the replacement of risk free rate in the Cryptocurrency market. This work presents a novel technique for pricing BTC futures contracts using conditional volatility and mean models. Intra-day high-frequency futures' return volatility and mean are modelled using different ML and econometric techniques. A comparison is made using statistical measures to find the model that best captures the intra-day conditional mean and volatility. Exponential generalized autoregressive conditional heteroskedasticity is shown to be an almost unbiased predictor of intra-day volatility, while a constant autoregressive moving average (0, 0) model best captures the conditional mean of the returns. A market directional high frequency trading algorithm is developed using the volatility and mean models. The algorithm first prices the futures contract at some future point of time using the volatility and mean regression models. Next, the slope between the current futures price and the expected price are used to predict the market direction. A long or short position is taken depending upon the expected market direction movement. Extensive back-testing results show absolute returns of 1500%-8000% depending upon the transaction fees and leverage used. On average, the market direction is predicted correctly 85% of the time by the best model. Finally, the trading technique is market neutral, in that it gives large positive returns, with low SD, in both bull and bear markets.;;;;;;;;;2;0;0;0;0;0;2;;;0266-4720;1468-0394;;;;;;;;;;Univ Auckland, Dept Elect Comp & Software Engn, Auckland, New Zealand;;;;2023-08-18;WOS:001042133700001;;

For that purpose, we integrate the well-known spillover methodology with a TVP VAR model estimated on a unique, vast dataset of roughly 300 thousand 5 min quotations for most heavily traded financial assets: crude oil, the US dollar, S&P 500 index, gold and US treasury bonds. This distinguishes our investigation from previous studies, which usually employ relatively short samples of daily or weekly data and focus on connectedness between two asset classes. We contribute to the literature across three margins. First, we document that market connectedness at intraday frequency presents a different picture on markets co-movement compared to the estimates obtained using daily data. Second, we show that at 5 min frequency volatility is mostly transmitted from the stock market and absorbed by the bond and dollar markets, with oil and gold markets being occasionally important for volatility transmission. Third, we present evidence that daily averages of intraday connectedness measures respond to changes in sentiment and market- specific uncertainty. Interestingly, our results contrast with earlier findings, as they show that connectedness among markets decreases in periods of high volatility owing to market-specific factors. Our study points to the importance of using high-frequency data in order to better understand financial and commodity markets dynamics.;;;;;;;;;4;0;0;0;0;0;4;;;0140-9883;1873-6181;;;;;;;;;;SGH Warsaw Sch Econ, Coll Econ Anal, Warsaw, PolandLinkoping Univ, Dept Management & Engn, Linkoping, Sweden;;;;2024-08-05;WOS:001279892400001;;

The empirical results show that the weekly online inflation significantly predicts the yield curve, especially the slope factor, whereas the monthly official inflation cannot predict the yield curve and is instead predicted by the yield curve factors. The mechanism analysis reveals that, due to low price stickiness, online inflation is more sensitive to short-term economic fluctuations and better reflects money market liquidity, thereby having significant predictive power for short-term interest rates and the slope factor.

This study evaluates the degree of connectedness among money market rates and also determines the most dominant money market rate(s) in Ghana. The basic finding is that the monetary policy rate has a low-to-moderate influence on volatility dynamics of other money market rates in Ghana across historical time-interval and time-frequency domains. This is a reflection of a generally weak capability of policy interest rate to drive other market rates in Ghana. Both monetary policy rate and Treasury bill rate are net transmitters of shocks, while interbank, lending and saving rates are net receivers of shocks in the money market. However, the Treasury bill emerges as the largest shock transmitter in the money market, across all forecast horizons and analytical domains. The lending rate is the largest shock recipient in the money market, largely from the Treasury bill rate which suggests ample evidence of fiscal dominance in Ghana. The study accentuates the exigency for monetary and fiscal policies to expeditiously address the domestic structural bottlenecks, especially in the financial sector and the fragile fiscal profile, in order to strengthen policy transmission in Ghana.;;;;;;;;;1;0;0;0;0;0;4;;;0038-2280;1813-6982;;;;;;;;;;Univ Witwatersrand, Wits Business Sch, Johannesburg, South AfricaBank Ghana, Res Dept, 1 Thorpe Rd,POB GP2674, Accra, Ghana;Bank Ghana;;;2021-05-04;WOS:000641833500001;;

The model is solved by a nonlinear method. The posterior distribution of the parameters in the model is found to be bi-modal. The degree of nominal rigidity is high at one mode (sticky price mode) but is low at the other mode (flexible price mode). I find that the degree of nominal rigidity is important for identifying macro shocks that affect the yield curve. When prices are more flexible, a slowly varying inflation target of the central bank is the main driver of the overall level of the yield curve by changing long-run inflation expectations. In contrast, when prices are more sticky, a highly persistent markup shock is the main driver. The posterior probability of each mode is sensitive to the use of observed proxies for inflation expectations. Ignoring additional information from survey data on inflation expectations significantly reduces the posterior probability of the flexible price mode. Incorporating this additional information suggests that yield curve fluctuations can be better understood by focusing on the flexible price mode. Considering nonlinearities of the model solution also increases the posterior probability of the flexible price mode, although to a lesser degree than using survey data information.

In the literature, the preferred choice of estimator is usually maximum likelihood (ML). ML has strong asymptotic justification but is not necessarily the best method in finite samples. This paper proposes a simulation-based method. When it is used in connection with ML, it can improve the finite-sample performance of the ML estimator while maintaining its good asymptotic properties. The method is implemented and evaluated here in the Black-Scholes option pricing model and in the Vasicek bond and bond option pricing model. It is especially favored when the bias in ML is large due to strong persistence in the data or strong nonlinearity in pricing functions. Monte Carlo studies show that the proposed procedures achieve bias reductions over ML estimation in pricing contingent claims when ML is biased. The bias reductions are sometimes accompanied by reductions in variance. Empirical applications to U.S. Treasury bills highlight the differences between the bond prices implied by the simulation-based approach and those delivered by ML. Some consequences for the statistical testing of contingent-claim pricing models are discussed.;;;;;;;;;20;0;0;0;0;0;26;;;0893-9454;1465-7368;;;;;;;;;;Singapore Management Univ, Sch Econ, Singapore 178903, SingaporeYale Univ, New Haven, CT 06520 USAUniv Auckland, Auckland 1, New ZealandUniv York, York YO10 5DD, N Yorkshire, England;;;;2009-09-01;WOS:000269799900010;;

In contrast to rational models of Bayesian learning the resulting Choquet Bayesian estimator results in a long-run bias that reflects the agent's ambiguity attitudes. By calibrating the standard equilibrium conditions of the consumption based asset pricing model we illustrate that our approach contributes towards a resolution of the risk-free rate puzzle. For a plausible parameterization we obtain a risk-free rate in the range of 3.5-5%. This is 1-2.5% closer to the empirical risk-free rate than according calibrations of the rational expectations model. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

S. government in February 2009 to provide backup capital to large financial institutions unable to raise sufficient capital from private investors. Under the terms of the CAP, a participating bank receives contingent capital by issuing preferred shares to the Treasury combined with embedded options for both parties: The bank gets the option to redeem the shares or convert them to common equity, with conversion mandatory after seven years; the Treasury earns dividends on the preferred shares and gets warrants on the bank's common equity. We develop a contingent claims framework in which to estimate market values of these CAP securities. The interaction between the competing options held by the buyer and issuer of these securities creates a game between the two parties, and our approach captures this strategic element of the joint valuation problem and clarifies the incentives it creates. We apply our method to the 18 publicly held bank holding companies that participated in the Supervisory Capital Assessment Program (the stress test) launched together with the CAP. On average, we estimate that compared to a market transaction, the CAP securities carry a net value of approximately 30% of the capital invested for a bank participating to the maximum extent allowed under the terms of the program. We also find that the net value varies widely across banks. We compare our estimates with abnormal stock price returns for the stress test banks at the time the terms of the CAP were announced; we find correlations between 0.78 and 0.85, depending on the precise choice of period and set of banks included. These results suggest that our valuation aligns with shareholder perception of the value of the program, prompting questions about industry reactions and the overall impact of the program.";;;;;;;;;17;0;0;0;0;0;26;;;0025-1909;1526-5501;;;;;;;;;;Columbia Univ, Grad Sch Business, New York, NY 10027 USAFed Reserve Bank New York, New York, NY 10045 USA;;;;2011-07-29;WOS:000292697700002;;

This work uses fuzzy inference system (FIS) and strongly typed genetic programming (STGP) to generate trading rules for the US stock market, a framework that we call FISTGP. The two embedded models have not been widely evaluated in financial applications, and according to the literature, their combination could improve forecasting performance. The fitness function used to train the STGP model is based on accuracy, optimizing the buy and sell signals, taking a different approach to the classic optimization of return-risk ratio. The rules are generated in a FIS framework, and the final signal depends on the amount of information that the investor relies on. The model is suited to each investor as a recommendation of when to change portfolio composition according to his or her particular criteria. Ternary rules are generated based on an economic interpretation, considering the risk-free rate as a part of more demanding rules. The model is applied to 90 of the most traded and active stocks in the US stock market. This approach generates important recommendations and delivers useful information to investors. The results show that the proposed model outperforms the Buy and Hold (B&H) strategy by 28.62% in the test period, considering excesses of return, with almost the same risk (1.28% higher). The other base models underperform in comparison to the B&H, with the proposed model also outperforming them. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V.

The study evaluates the QLBS algorithm's performance across different state variables and scenarios for a European put option, showing that the model accurately estimates option prices under varying volatility levels, hedging frequencies, risk-free rates, and when dividends are included. Additionally, the QLBS method shows robust performance in pricing and hedging options across different moneyness levels, with more pronounced deviations from the BSM model for deep in-the-money options under higher risk aversion. The empirical analysis also incorporates proportional transaction costs using at-the-money S&P 500 call options, revealing varied implications for profitability and risk mitigation, influenced by the choice of state variables.

The purpose of this paper is to assess the effect of transaction costs on the predictability of the term structure by using the threshold vector error correction model, which allows for the nonlinear adjustment to the long-run equilibrium relationship. A significant amount of threshold effect is found, and the adjustment coefficients are regime-dependent.

A nonlinear framework is developed based on a smooth transition model for which the effects of shocks can vary across business cycles when financial indicators modify both the endogenous and state variables. Global financial variables are shown to significantly affect real growth in the Euro area, particularly during periods of recession. Changes in stock market index and yield slope have asymmetric effects on real growth. In recessionary periods, the slope of the US yield curve does not have a significant impact on growth in the Euro area. Crown Copyright (C) 2012 Published by Elsevier B.V.

These may include government debt, bank deposits, and asset-backed securities, among others. The International Monetary Fund estimated potential safe assets at more than $114 trillion worldwide in 2011, more than seven times the U.S. economic output that year.To treat any contract as if it were risk-free seems delusional after apparently super-safe public and private debt markets collapsed overnight. Nonetheless, safe asset supply and demand have been invoked to explain shadow banking, financial crises, and prolonged economic stagnation. The economic literature speaks of safe assets in terms of poorly understood natural forces or essential particles newly discovered in a super-collider. Law is virtually absent in this account.Our Article makes four contributions that help to establish law's place in the safe asset debate and connect the debate to post-crisis law scholarship. First, we describe the legal architecture of safe assets. Existing theories do not explain where safe assets get their safety. Understanding this is an essential first step to designing a regulatory response to the risks they entail. Second, we offer a unified analytical framework that links the safe asset debate with post crisis legal critiques of money, banking, structured finance and bankruptcy. Third, we highlight sources of instability and distortion in the legal architecture, and the political commitments embedded in it. Fourth, we offer preliminary prescriptions to correct some of these failings.Precisely because there are no risk-free contracts, state intervention supplies the essential infrastructure to let people act as if some contracts were risk-free. The law constructs and maintains safe asset fictions, and it places them at the foundation of institutions and markets. This project is unavoidably distributive and fraught with distortions.;;;;;;;;;26;0;0;0;0;0;28;;;0741-9457;2376-5925;;;;;;;;;;Georgetown Law, Washington, DC 20001 USAPeter G Peterson Inst Int Econ, Washington, DC 20036 USAColorado Law, Acad Affairs, Boulder, CO USA;Georgetown LawColorado Law;;;2016-06-01;WOS:000406438000002;;

Due to its clandestine nature, it is difficult to reliably estimate the amount of taxes evaded. To fight tax fraud, this investigation details the construction and evaluation of a corporate relation extraction system designed to access an unstructured knowledge-base and extract corporate relations for further validation. The system was developed in response to a need raised by the Treasury and Finance Department of the Provincial Council of Gipuzkoa (Spain).

Despite the huge number of contributions in the field, the development of a reliable framework for both fitting and forecasting under various market conditions (either stable or very volatile) still remains a topical issue. Motivated by this problem, this study introduces a methodology relying on optimal time-varying parameters for three and five factor models in the Nelson-Siegel class that can be employed for an effective in-sample fitting and out-of-sample forecasting of the term structure. In detail, for the in-sample fitting we discussed a two-step estimation procedure leading to optimal models parameters and evaluated the performances of this approach in terms of flexibility and fitting accuracy gains. For what it concerns the forecasting, we suggest an approach overcoming the well-known issue between the stability of factor models' parameters and the optimal dynamic decay terms. To such aim, we use either autoregressive or machine learning techniques as local data generating processes based on the optimal parameters time series derived in the in-line fitting step. The so-obtained values are then employed to get day-ahead predictions of the yield curve. We assessed the proposed framework on daily spot rates of the BRICS (Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa) bond market. The experimental analysis illustrated that (i) time-varying parameters ensure a significant boost in the models fitting power and a more faithful representation of the yield curves dynamics; (ii) the proposed approach provides also stable and accurate predictions.";;;;;;;;;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;;;0927-7099;1572-9974;;;;;;;;;;Univ Genoa, Dept Econ & Business Studies, I-16126 Genoa, Italy;;;;2024-05-31;WOS:001229243100001;;

Nonlinear error correction arises because portfolio adjustment is an 'on-off' process, which occurs only when disequilibrium in the bill market is large enough to induce investors to incur the transaction costs associated with buying/selling bills. This, together with heterogeneity of transaction costs, implies that the strength of aggregate error correction depends on both the distribution of casts and the extent of disequilibrium in the market. Smooth transition models are used to describe an aggregate adjustment process which is strong when the market is distant from equilibrium, but becomes weaker as the market approaches equilibrium. Linearity tests indicate that the types of nonlinearities that would be induced by transactions costs are statistically significant, and estimated models which incororate these nonlinearities outperform their linear counterparts, both in sample and out of sample.;;;;;;;;;105;2;0;0;0;0;112;;;0305-9049;1468-0084;;;;;;;;;;;;;;1997-11-01;WOS:A1997YG78000003;;

Estimated based on a version of the Expectation-Maximization algorithm, the regime in RSMC indicates either economic expansion or contraction. Then, we apply RSMC to the monthly time series of the sovereign credit rating of 41 nations from January 1994 to December 2018. At first, we confirm that the estimation of RSMC is superior to a homogeneous Markov chain. It implies that the credit rating dynamics are subject to the underlying economic condition. Secondly, we observe that the second tier and non-investment credit ratings in economic contractions are likely to be downgraded. We also detect the continental clustering of economic contractions for the Asian currency and European sovereign debt crises. Lastly, we discover that the forecasting performance of RSMC is superior to that of the benchmark, especially for the second tier and non-investment credit ratings. In conclusion, we claim that RSMC can improve the management of sovereign credit risk exposures.;;;;;;;;;5;1;0;0;0;0;6;;;2169-3536;;;;;;;;;;;Seoul Natl Univ, Dept Ind Engn, Seoul 08826, South KoreaHanyang Univ, Dept Ind Engn, Seoul 04763, South KoreaSamsung Elect, Mobile Commun Business, Big Data Analyt Grp, Suwon 16677, South Korea;;;;2019-09-18;WOS:000484227500009;;

The models were recursively estimated using 17 additional predictors chosen by a genetic algorithm applied to an initial list of 155 predictors. These forecasts were then used to dynamically choose portfolios formed by these assets and the riskless asset proxied by the 3-month US treasury bills. Although we did not find any predictability in the stock market, positive results were obtained for REITs and especially for bonds. The Bayesian-based approaches applied to just the returns of the three risky assets resulted in portfolios that remarkably outperform the portfolios based on the historical means and covariances and the equally weighted portfolio in terms of certainty equivalent return, Sharpe ratio, Sortino ratio and even Conditional Value-at-Risk at 5%.

Examples include structural business cycle estimation, implied volatility smile, the yield curve. Having embedded these quantities into continuous random curves, estimation of the covariance function is needed to extract factors, perform dimensionality reduction, and conduct inference on the factor scores. A series expansion for the covariance function is considered. Under summability restrictions on the absolute values of the coefficients in the series expansion, an estimation procedure that is resilient to overfitting is proposed. Under certain conditions, the rate of consistency for the resulting estimator achieves the minimax rate, allowing the observations to be weakly dependent. When the domain of the functional data is K(>1) dimensional, the absolute summability restriction of the coefficients avoids the so called curse of dimensionality. As an application, a Box-Pierce statistic to test independence of partially observed functional data is derived.

To illustrate the general construction, we approximate the value of the US treasury bond in an HJM framework, and the results are compared with those derived by the Monte Carlo method and the ensemble Kalman filter. The proposed method is computationally efficient compared with the standard techniques, and it provides a convenient way to compute the statistical moments of the solution numerically.

Separate bandwidths are used for drift and volatility estimation. In the log P-splines approach, different smoothness for different time varying coefficients is feasible by assigning different penalty parameters.

Moreover, they generate sizable economic values, and their predictability is not spanned by the yield curve.

Past studies have different arguments concerning growth lags, structural breaks, and ultimately the ability of the yield curve to forecast economic growth. This paper finds such results to be dependent on the estimation and forecasting techniques employed. By allowing various interest rates to act as explanatory variables and various window sizes for the out-of-sample forecasts, significant forecasts from many window sizes can be found. These seemingly good forecasts may face issues, including persistent forecasting errors. However, by using statistical learning algorithms, such issues can be cured to some extent. The overall result suggests, by scientifically deciding the window sizes, interest rate data, and learning algorithms, many outperforming forecasts be produced for all lags from one quarter to 3 years, although some may be worse than the others due to the irreducible noise of the data.;;;;;;;;;10;0;0;0;0;0;12;;;0277-6693;1099-131X;;;;;;;;;;Univ Oxford, Dept Stat, Oxford OX1 3LB, England;;;;2020-03-19;WOS:000520557900001;;

This paper proposes a model called smooth transition mixed data sampling (STMIDAS) regression, which relaxes both of these assumptions. Simulation exercises indicate that the improvements in forecasting accuracy from the use of mixed data sampling are larger in nonlinear than in linear specifications. When forecasting output growth with financial variables in real time, statistically significant improvements over a linear regression are more likely to arise from forecasting with STMIDAS than with MIDAS regressions.

For this reason, they are difficult to predict and appear as one of the main problems in macroeconomics forecasts. A classic example turns out to be the great recession that occurred between 2008 and 2009 that was not predicted. In this paper, the goal is to give a different, although complementary, approach concerning the classical econometric techniques, and to show how Machine Learning (ML) techniques may improve short-term forecasting accuracy. As a case study, we use Italian data on GDP and a few related variables. In particular, we evaluate the goodness of fit of the forecasting proposed model in a case study of the Italian GDP. The algorithm is trained on Italian macroeconomic variables over the period 1995:Q1-2019:Q2. We also compare the results using the same dataset through Classic Linear Regression Model.

Our study shows that the Markovian models are superior to the probit models in detecting a recession and capturing the recession duration.

However, the fuzzy approach should not be considered as a substitute for the probabilistic approach but rather as a complementary way to describe the model peculiarities. Here, we consider, in particular, the Black and Scholes model for option pricing, and we show that the fuzzification of some key parameters enables a sensitivity analysis of the option price with respect to the risk-free interest rate, the final value of the underlying stock price, the volatility, and also better forecasts (see Thavaneswaran et al. (2009)[12] for details). The sensitivities with respect to the variables of the model are represented by different letters of the Greek alphabet and they play an important role in the definition of the shape of the fuzzy option price.

We firstly construct investor attention index by using the Google search volume index (SVI) based on a broad set of words related to oil-related variables and terms that are directly linked to real economy to measure investor attention. Then the empirical work is performed via a novel hybrid approach and WN model (Westerlund and Narayan, 2012, 2014) that account for characteristics of persistency, endogeneity, and heteroskedasticity. The empirical results show that investor attention does exhibit statistically and economically significant in-sample and out-of-sample forecasting power to directly forecast oil prices for both daily data and weekly data. In addition, the results exhibit the term structure character, which are helpful for understanding the financial phenomena that irrational attentions have more effect in short-term decision-making.

Inclan, G. Tiao, Use of cumulative sums of squares for retrospective detection of changes of variance, J. Am. Stat. Assoc. 89 (1994) 913-923]. The ICSS algorithm can detect regime shifts in the volatility of the interest rate changes. A general model allows for endogenously determined changes in variance while the more restrictive model forces the variance to follow the same process throughout the sample period. A comparison of the out-of-sample volatility forecasting performance of two competing models is made using asymmetric error measures. The asymmetric error statistics penalize models for under- or over-predicting volatility. The results shed light on the importance of ignoring volatility regime shifts when performing out-of-sample forecasts. The findings are important to financial market participants who require accurate forecasts of future volatility in order to implement and evaluate asset performance. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V.

Our diffusion indexes are constructed using principal component analysis with both targeted and untargeted predictors, with targeting done using the lasso and elastic net. Our findings can be summarized as follows. First, the marginal predictive content of real-time diffusion indexes is significant for the preponderance of theindividualmodels that we examine. The exception to this finding is the post Great Recession period. Second, forecastcombinationsthat include only yield variables result in our most accurate predictions, for most sample periods and maturities. In this case, diffusion indexes do not have marginal predictive content for yields and do not seem to reflect unspanned risks. This points to the continuing usefulness of DNS and NSS models that are purely yield driven. Finally, we find that the use of fully revised macroeconomic data may have an important confounding effect upon results obtained when forecasting yields, as prior research has indicated that diffusion indexes are often useful for predicting yields when constructed using fully revised data, regardless of whether forecast combination is used, or not. Nevertheless, our findings also underscore the potential importance of using machine learning, data reduction, and shrinkage methods in contexts such as term structure modeling.";;;;;;;;;10;1;0;0;0;0;13;;;0883-7252;1099-1255;;;;;;;;;;Rutgers State Univ, Dept Econ, 75 Hamilton St, New Brunswick, NJ 08901 USABlackRock, Hong Kong, Peoples R China;BlackRock;;;2020-07-24;WOS:000548142300001;;

The goal of this article is to estimate interest rate curves by using Support Vector Regression (SVR), a method derived from the Statistical Learning Theory developed by Vapnik (1995). The motivation is that SVR features these extra capabilities at a low estimation cost. The SVR is specified by a loss function, a kernel function and a smoothing parameter. SVR models the daily U.S. dollar interest rate swap curves, from 1997 to 2001. As expected from a priori and sensibility analyses, the SVR equipped with the kernel generating a spline with an infinite number of nodes was the best performing SVR. Comparing this SVR with other models, it achieved the best cross-validation interpolation performance in controlling the bias-variance trade-off and generating the lowest error considering the desired accuracy fixed by the bid-ask spreads.;;;;;;;;;1;0;0;0;0;0;1;;;0747-4938;1532-4168;;;;;;;;;;Gavea Investimentos, Rio De Janeiro, Brazil;Gavea Investimentos;;;2010-01-01;WOS:000281853600010;;

Although this model is a promising candidate for nonlinear multiple time series modeling, high dimensionality of the parameters and lack of method for computing the standard errors of estimates limit its application to real data. The contribution of this paper is threefold. First, a form of parameter constraints is introduced with an efficient EM algorithm for estimation. Second, an accurate method for computing standard errors is presented for the model with and without parameter constraints. Lastly, a hypothesis-testing approach based on likelihood ratio tests is proposed, which aids in the selection of unnecessary parameters and leads to the greater efficiency at the estimation. A case study employing U.S. Treasury constant maturity rates illustrates the applicability of the mixture vector autoregressive model with parameter constraints, and the importance of using a reliable method to compute standard errors.

The two-regime Markov-switch model that we used as a nonlinear filter allows the dynamic behavior of the economy to vary between expansions and recessions in terms of duration and volatility. We found that the bank term structure, the public term structure, and the spread based on the call rate predicted all recessions with a comfortable lead, although they lagged some of the recoveries by a few months. The bank-public spread generates a series of false signals, and missed completely the upturn in the mid-1970s, but detected the last two recoveries with an average lead of nearly 12 months. The source of the predictive power of interest rate spreads lies in the information they contain not only about monetary policy, but also about an assortment of general macroeconomic shocks. The filter probabilities from three of the interest rate differentials also foreshadowed the long swings in the German inflation rate remarkably well, with a lead time of 2-4 years without any false signals.

The model used here is the stochastic volatility model. The filters that we propose are known as projection filters, and a brief derivation of such filters is given. The second problem is introduced in detail, and a possible use of different filtering techniques is hinted at. In fact the filters used for this problem in (2) and part of the literature can be interpreted as projection filters and we will make some remarks on how more general and possibly more suitable projection filters can be constructed.

Changes in the VIX index have an immediate impact on asset price returns, but the effect diminishes over time, suggesting the need for timely updates to investment strategies.

The analysis, which uses the simulated maximum likelihood procedure proposed by Durham and Gallant (2002), provides new insights regarding several previously unresolved questions. For single factor models, I find that the volatility, not the drift, is the critical component in model specification. Allowing for additional flexibility beyond a constant term in the drift provides negligible benefit. While constant drift would appear to imply that the short rate is nonstationary, in fact, stationarity is volatility-induced. The simple constant elasticity of volatility model fits weekly observations of the three-month Treasury bill rate remarkably well but is easily rejected when compared with more flexible volatility specifications over daily data. The methodology of Durham and Gallant can also be used to estimate stochastic volatility models. While adding the latent volatility component provides a large improvement in the likelihood for the physical process, it does little to improve bond-pricing performance. (C) 2003 Elsevier B.V.

First, results are interpretable since the impact of each explanatory variable on each forecast can be calculated. Second, it allows for visualizing persistent temporal patterns and identifying significant events and different regimes. Third, it provides quantile regressions and permits training the model on multiple time series from different distributions. Results suggest that TFTs outperform regression models, especially in periods of turbulence such as the COVID-19 shock. Interesting economic interpretations are obtained depending on whether the country has domestic demand-led or export-led growth. In essence, TFT is revealed as a new tool that artificial intelligence provides to economists and policy makers, with enormous prospects for the future.;;;;;;;;;7;0;0;0;0;0;7;;;;2227-7390;;;;;;;;;;Univ Carlos III, Dept Business Adm, Getafe 28903, Madrid, SpainBanco Espana, C Alcala 48, Madrid 28014, Spain;;;;2023-07-06;WOS:001014791900001;;

Rather than using discretely compounded market rates as a proxy for the instantaneous short rate of interest, we derive a relationship between observed LIBOR rates and certain unobserved instantaneous forward rates. We determine the stochastic dynamics for these rates under the risk-neutral measure and propose a filtering estimation algorithm for a time-discretised version of the resulting interest rate dynamics based on dynamic Bayesian updating in order to estimate the volatility function. Our time discretisation can be justified by the fact that data are observed discretely in time. The method is applied to US Treasury rates of various maturities to compute a (posterior) distribution for the parameters of the volatility specification. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

Here we leverage the extraordinary new high-resolution infrared imaging from JWST to begin the study of dust-embedded star clusters in nearby galaxies throughout the Local Volume. We present a technique for identifying dust-embedded clusters in NGC 7496 (18.7 Mpc), the first galaxy to be observed by the PHANGS-JWST Cycle 1 Treasury Survey. We select sources that have strong 3.3 mu m PAH emission based on a F300M - F335M color excess and identify 67 candidate embedded clusters. Only eight of these are found in the PHANGS-HST optically selected cluster catalog, and all are young (six have SED fit ages of similar to 1 Myr). We find that this sample of embedded cluster candidates may significantly increase the census of young clusters in NGC 7496 from the PHANGS-HST catalog; the number of clusters younger than similar to 2 Myr could be increased by a factor of 2. Candidates are preferentially located in dust lanes and are coincident with the peaks in the PHANGS-ALMA CO (2-1) maps. We take a first look at concentration indices, luminosity functions, SEDs spanning from 2700 angstrom to 21 mu m, and stellar masses (estimated to be between similar to 10(4) and 10(5) M (circle dot)). The methods tested here provide a basis for future work to derive accurate constraints on the physical properties of embedded clusters, characterize the completeness of cluster samples, and expand analysis to all 19 galaxies in the PHANGS-JWST sample, which will enable basic unsolved problems in star formation and cluster evolution to be addressed.";;;;;;;;;19;0;0;0;0;0;19;;;2041-8205;2041-8213;;;;;;;;;;Univ Arizona, Steward Observ, 933 North Cherry Ave, Tucson, AZ 85721 USACONICET UNLP, Inst Astrofis La Plata, Paseo Bosque S-N,B1900FWA, La Plata, ArgentinaGemini Observ NSFs NOIRLab, 950 North Cherry Ave, Tucson, AZ USASpace Telescope Sci Inst, 3700 San Martin Dr, Baltimore, MD 21218 USAJohns Hopkins Univ, Dept Phys & Astron, Baltimore, MD 21218 USAPSL Univ, Sorbonne Univ, CNRS, LERMA,Observ Paris, F-75014 Paris, FranceUniv Toledo, Ritter Astrophys Res Ctr, Toledo, OH 43606 USAStockholm Univ, Oskar Klein Ctr Cosmoparticle Phys, Dept Phys, AlbaNova, SE-10691 Stockholm, SwedenUniv Antofagasta, Ctr Astron CITEVA, Ave Angamos 601, Antofagasta, ChileUniv Wyoming, Dept Phys & Astron, Laramie, WY 82071 USAAURA European Space Agcy ESA, Space Telescope Sci Inst, 3700 San Martin Dr, Baltimore, MD 21218 USAUniv Oxford, Subdept Astrophys, Dept Phys, Keble Rd, Oxford OX1 3RH, EnglandMax Planck Inst Astron, Konigstuhl 17, D-69117 Heidelberg, GermanyUniv Alberta, Dept Phys, Edmonton, AB T6G 2E1, CanadaOhio State Univ, Dept Astron, 140 West 18th Ave, Columbus, OH 43210 USACtr Cosmol & Astroparticle Phys, 191 West Woodruff Ave, Columbus, OH 43210 USAEuropean Southern Observ, Karl Schwarzschild Str 2, D-85748 Garching, GermanyUniv Lyon1, Univ Lyon, Ctr Rech Astrophys Lyon, ENS Lyon,CNRS,UMR5574, F-69230 St Genis Laval, FranceUniv Calif San Diego, Ctr Astrophys & Space Sci, 9500 Gilman Dr, San Diego, CA 92093 USACosm Origins Life COOL Res DAO40, Laramie, WY USAAustralian Natl Univ, Res Sch Astron & Astrophys, Weston, ACT 2611, AustraliaARC Ctr Excellence All Sky Astrophys 3 Dimens AST, Canberra, ACT, AustraliaHeidelberg Univ, Astron Rechen Inst, Zentrum Astron, Monchhofstr 12-14, D-69120 Heidelberg, GermanyUniv Bonn, Argelander Inst Astron, Hugel 71, D-53121 Bonn, GermanyHeidelberg Univ, Inst Theoret Astrophys, Zentrum Astron, Albert Ueberle Str 2, D-69120 Heidelberg, GermanyHeidelberg Univ, Interdisziplinares Zentrum Wissensch Rechnen, Neuenheimer Feld 205, D-69120 Heidelberg, GermanyMax Planck Inst Extraterr Phys MPE, Giessenbachstr 1, D-85748 Garching, GermanyUniv Connecticut, Dept Phys, 196A Auditorium Rd,Unit 3046, Storrs, CT 06269 USAINAF Arcetri Astrophys Observ, Largo E Fermi 5, I-50125 Florence, ItalyLeibniz Inst Astrophys Potsdam AIP, Sternwarte 16, D-14482 Potsdam, GermanyUniv Western Australia, Int Ctr Radio Astron Res, 7 Fairway, Crawley, WA 6009, AustraliaIRAM, 300 Rue Piscine, F-38400 St Martin Dheres, FranceSorbonne Univ, PSL Res Univ, LERMA, Observ Paris,CNRS, F-75014 Paris, FranceNatl Radio Astron Observ, 520 Edgemont Rd, Charlottesville, VA 22903 USAUniv Virginia, 530 McCormick Rd, Charlottesville, VA 22904 USAObserv Carnegie Inst Sci, 813 St Barbara St, Pasadena, CA USAUniv Chile, Dept Astron, Camino Observ 1515, Santiago, ChileNatl Astron Observ Japan, 2-21-1 Osawa, Mitaka, Tokyo 1818588, JapanUniv Toulouse, IRAP, CNRS, CNES,UPS, Toulouse, France;Gemini Observ NSFs NOIRLabCtr Cosmol & Astroparticle PhysCosm Origins Life COOL Res DAO40ARC Ctr Excellence All Sky Astrophys 3 Dimens ASTIRAM;;;2023-03-22;WOS:000941973200001;;

Furthermore, the under-reaction is risk-specific: bonds with better credit quality underreact more to default risk, while those with worse quality underreact more to interest rates. The under-reactions imply substantial out-of-sample return predictability, and investors appear to be leaving too much money on the table. The results are consistent with behavioral inattention models in which investors endogenously allocate more attention to payoff-relevant (or salient) risks, and they are not explained by traditional trading friction mechanisms.

Credit bond defaults not only increase the financing costs of enterprises but also affect the efficiency of debt issuance and even lead to the spread of risks in the financial market. Accurately identifying bond default risks, clarifying the characteristics of bond defaults, and understanding the default risk mechanism are of crucial importance.Methods This paper takes corporate credit bonds as the research object and analyzes bond defaults from both macro and micro perspectives. From a macro perspective, it confirms the logical transmission between macro factors and bond defaults through causal relationships and grasps the overall characteristics of bond defaults by combining association rule mining and descriptive statistical research methods. Bonds are divided into a risk-free bond group and a risky bond group, and association rules are mined in four dimensions: the bond issuance region of the enterprise, whether the issuer is listed, the attributes of the issuing enterprise, and whether the enterprise bond is guaranteed. Based on these rules, a cross-analysis of bond risk factors is conducted. From a micro perspective, taking each bond as the research object, a bond default identification system is established, and default predictions are made based on the ensemble learning algorithm. The important characteristics of default bonds are analyzed from the perspective of whether the issuer is a state-owned enterprise, and further cause difference analysis is conducted.Results The results show that M1 and M2 have an impact on bond defaults, and the ensemble machine learning algorithm can accurately predict bond default risks and obtain key factors for bond risk identification. It is reasonable to choose macro indicators to predict bond defaults.Discussion Based on the experimental conclusions, this paper discusses and analyzes the bond risk evolution process and the reasons for risk concentration in certain industries, which is helpful for a comprehensive understanding of bond default risks. Our research can provide tool references and guidance for risk management in the actual bond market.;;;;;;;;;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;;;2296-424X;;;;;;;;;;;China Univ Geosci, Sch Econ & Management, Beijing, Peoples R China;;;;2025-04-15;WOS:001462624200001;;

We address this omission by investigating two core issues. One is whether commercial banks that ended up being subject to FDIC resolution received CPP funds. The other is whether the non allocation of CPP funds made FDIC receivership more likely for viable commercial banks. Our findings show almost no overlap between CPP-funded and FDIC-resolved commercial banks, but we provide evidence that a significant number of FDIC-resolved banks could have avoided receivership if they had been allocated CPP funding. By comparing estimated funding and resolution costs we also show that bailing out more banks would have been cost-efficient. While our results do not allow for any policy suggestion on the optimality of bailouts per se, they suggest that once a bailout program is already on the table, it is better to err on the side of rescuing too many rather than too few banks.

First, earnings and dividend yields move with long-term expected inflation and risk-free rates. Second, analysts' forecasts of nominal growth, not real growth, vary little with expected inflation. These patterns are remarkable because financial economists predict exactly the opposite. One explanation for these contrary findings is that stock prices are too high (low) when inflation is low (high), because investors confuse nominal and real growth rates. The authors assert that investors are unlikely to be so systematically naive about expected inflation and argue that the contrary evidence is, in fact, consistent with a rational market. The key insight offered by the authors is that reported earnings include inflationary holding gains, which causes higher earnings yields when inflation is high (the first regularity) and, in turn, explains why forecasts of nominal growth need not vary with inflation (the second regularity).;;;;;;;;;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;;;0095-4918;2168-8656;;;;;;;;;;Yale Univ, New Haven, CT 06520 USANicholas Applegate Capital Management, San Diego, CA USA;Nicholas Applegate Capital Management;;;2009-06-01;WOS:000268778200017;;

Parameter estimates are determined via adaptive filters designed to extract hidden information from an observable time series. An application involving the dynamic behaviour of spot interest rates is considered. More specifically, we present an empirical study aimed at capturing accurately, on the basis of some benchmarks and statistical validation, the evolution of three country-specific rates in the European zone. Our analysis reveals some similar yield-rate and risk characteristics as well as independent market behaviours of the three EU sovereign states. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Several extensions to the baseline Euler equation model are investigated. The results are insensitive to using linear versus nonlinear specifications, different instruments or different consumption data, but they are very sensitive to asset returns. With risk-free returns, the elasticity of intertemporal substitution is tightly estimated around zero, while with stock market returns, it is significantly positive but very imprecisely estimated.

First, it uses distressed debt prices to estimate recovery rates at default. In this regard, estimates are obtained for three recovery rate models: recovery of face value, recovery of Treasury, and recovery of market value. We show that identifying the economic default date, as distinct from the recorded default date, is crucial to obtaining unbiased estimates. The economic default date is defined to be the first date when the market prices the firm's debt as if it has defaulted. An implication is that the standard industry practice of using 30-day post default prices to compute recovery rate yields biased estimates. Second, we construct and estimate a distressed debt pricing model. We use this model to implicitly estimate the parameters of the embedded recovery rate process and to price distressed debt. Our distressed debt pricing model fits market prices well, with an average pricing error of less than one basis point.;;;;;;;;;12;0;0;0;0;0;17;;;1380-6645;1573-7144;;;;;;;;;;Cornell Univ, Johnson Sch Management, Ithaca, NY 14853 USAUniv Calif Berkeley, Dept IEOR, Berkeley, CA 95720 USAKamakura Corp, New York, NY USA;Kamakura Corp;;;2008-10-01;WOS:000207665900001;;

The distinctive feature of the class is that Car models are specified by means of the conditional Laplace transforms. This approach allows for simple derivation of the ergodicity conditions and ensures the existence of forecasting distributions in closed form, at any horizon. The last property is of particular interest for applications to finance and economics that investigate the term structure of variables and/or of their nonlinear transforms. The Car class includes a number of time-series models that already exist in the literature, as well as new models introduced in this paper.

This is a synthesis of evidence on the size of improvements to human life experience that can be expected from changing objective, policy-amenable circumstances. The wealth of data on people's self-reported satisfaction with life in a wide variety of circumstances, from around the world, including respondents undergoing a diversity of changes and life events and subject to a variety of public policies and policy changes, has provided a rich base of knowledge about what makes life good. This growing research literature has in recent years been met with interest from central governments looking for accountable but more human-centred approaches to measuring progress, as well as for communicating objectives, making policy, and allocating resources. Meanwhile, frameworks for benefit-cost accounting using inference from life satisfaction data have been devised. In some cases central government finance departments and treasuries are incorporating this approach into their formal methodology for budgeting. The body of causal inference about these effects is still somewhat diffuse. Collating, reviewing, and synthesizing such evidence should be led initially by academia and ultimately by a broad academic, civil society, and government collaboration. We report on the assembly of a database of summary estimates for Canada, supplemented where needed by evidence from around the world.

Investor attention on the COVID-19 pandemic is likely to play an important role in this response. Focusing on the Bitcoin futures market, this paper aims to investigate whether pandemic attention can explain and forecast the returns and volatility of Bitcoin futures. Using the daily Google search volume index for the coronavirus keyword from January 2020 to February 2022 to represent pandemic attention, this paper implements the Granger causality test, Vector Autoregression (VAR) analysis, and several linear effects analyses. The findings suggest that pandemic attention is a granger cause of Bitcoin returns and volatility. It appears that an increase in pandemic attention results in lower returns and excessive volatility in the Bitcoin futures market, even after taking into account the interactive effects and the influence of controlling other financial markets. In addition, this paper carries out the out-of-sample forecasts and finds that the predictive models with pandemic attention do improve the out-of-sample forecast performance, which is enhanced in the prediction of Bitcoin returns while diminished in the prediction of Bitcoin volatility as the forecast horizon is extended. Finally, the predictive models including pandemic attention can generate significant economic benefits by constructing portfolios among Bitcoin futures and risk-free assets. All the results demonstrate that pandemic attention plays an important and non-negligible role in the Bitcoin futures market. This paper can provide enlightens for subsequent research on Bitcoin based on investor attention sparked by public emergencies.;;;;;;;;;6;0;0;0;0;0;7;;;;2296-2565;;;;;;;;;;Univ Nottingham, Business Sch, Nottingham Univ, Nottingham, EnglandBeijing Technol & Business Univ, Sch Econ, Beijing, Peoples R China;;;;2023-05-04;WOS:000974624700001;37124792;

Monthly data from January 1998 to May 2023 for the US, the UK and the euro area are used for the analysis. The estimated impulse responses show significant effects of the functional shocks on both inflation and output. In addition, threshold functional local projections indicate that the effects are nonlinear and depend on central bank credibility. Further, inflation expectations shocks have similar effects to supply (demand) ones when they are driven by long-term (short-term) changes. In the presence of an inverted (steepening) real interest rate term structure, the effects are inflationary (deflationary) and expansionary (recessionary). Finally, the responses of inflation, output and the policy rate are driven primarily by the slope and curvature factors of the term structure shocks, which contain important information not captured by traditional scalar shocks.;;;;;;;;;1;0;0;0;0;0;1;;;1610-2878;1610-2886;;;;;;;;;;London South Bank Univ, London SE1 0AA, EnglandBrunel Univ London, Dept Econ & Finance, Uxbridge UB8 3PH, England;;;;2024-06-29;WOS:001251879700001;;

The stability conditions of this system are given for a nonlinearly integrated bivariate series. Under these stability conditions, the difference between the two series exhibits threshold-type nonlinearity. It is possible to construct a threshold error correction model from the min-max processes. Neglected nonlinearity tests are applied, both to the univariate series and to the bivariate system, in order to detect nonlinearity, and it turns out that the tests using the bivariate series have better power. We apply the min-max model to U.S. Treasury bills and commercial paper interest rates. The spread of these interest rates shows threshold-type nonlinearity, and this model outperforms a linear model in terms of its predictability for out-of-sample data. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V.

We use the classification and regression tree methodology and its random forest extension, which permits the detection of key variables driving binary crisis outcomes, allows for interactions among key variables and determines critical tipping points. We distinguish between basic country conditions, country structural characteristics and international developments. We find that crises are more varied than they are similar. For banking crises, we find that low net interest rate spreads in the banking sector and a shallow, or inverted, yield curve is their most important forerunners in the short term. In the longer term, it is high house price inflation. For currency crises, high domestic short-term rates coupled with overvalued exchange rates are the most powerful short-term predictors. We find that both country structural characteristics and international developments are relevant banking-crisis predictors. Currency crises, however, seem to be driven more by country idiosyncratic, short-term developments. We find that some variables, such as the domestic credit gap, provide important unconditional signals, but it is difficult to use them as conditional signals and, more importantly, to find relevant threshold values.

Design/methodology/approach To extract the latent factors (level, slope and curvature) of the Turkish sovereign yield curve, we estimate conventional Nelson and Siegel (1987) model with nonlinear least squares. Then, we decompose oil price shocks into supply, demand and risk shocks using structural VAR (structural VAR) models. After this separation, we apply Engle (2002) dynamic conditional correlation GARCH (DCC-GARCH (1,1)) method to investigate time-varying co-movements between yield curve factors and oil price shocks. Finally, using the LP (local projections) proposed by Jorda (2005), we estimate the impulse-response functions to examine the impact of different oil price shocks on yield curve factors. Findings Our results demonstrate that the various oil price shocks influence the yield curve factors quite differently. A supply shock leads to a statistically significant increase in the level factor. This result shows that elevated oil prices due to supply disruptions are interpreted as a signal of a surge in inflation expectations since the cost channel prevails. Besides, unanticipated demand shocks have a positive impact on the slope factor as a result of the central bank policy response for offsetting the elevated inflation expectations. Finally, a risk shock is associated with a decrease in the curvature factor indicating that risk shocks influence the medium-term bonds due to the deflationary pressure resulting from depressed economic conditions. Practical implications Our results provide new insights to understand the driving forces of yield curve movements induced by various oil shocks to formulate appropriate policy responses. Originality/value The study contributes to the literature by two main dimensions. First, the recent oil shock identification scheme of Ready (2018) is modified using the geopolitical oil price risk index to capture the changes in the risk perceptions of oil markets driven by geopolitical tensions such as terrorism and conflicts and sanctions. The modified identification scheme attributes more power to demand shocks in explaining the variation of the oil price compared to that of the baseline scheme. Second, it provides recent evidence that distinguishes the impact of oil demand and supply shocks on Turkey's yield curve.;;;;;;;;;9;0;0;0;2;0;9;;;1746-8809;1746-8817;;;;;;;;;;Copenhagen Business Sch, Dept Econ, Frederiksberg, DenmarkCent Bank Republ Turkey, Mkt Dept, Ankara, TurkeyCent Bank Republ Turkey, Res & Monetary Policy Dept, Ankara, TurkeyUniv St Andrews, Sch Management, St Andrews, Fife, ScotlandCent Bank Republ Turkey, Banking & Financial Inst Dept, Ankara, TurkeyTrinity Coll Dublin, Trinity Business Sch, Dublin, IrelandUniv Econ Ho Chi Minh City, Inst Business Res, Ho Chi Minh City, VietnamUniv Sydney, Sch Business, Sydney, NSW, Australia;;;;2021-02-22;WOS:000620151800001;;

We quantify the rate n(t) of aftershocks following an interest-rate change at time T and find power-law decay which scales as n(t-T) similar to (t-T)(-Omega), with Omega positive. Surprisingly, we find that the same law describes the rate n'(vertical bar t-T vertical bar) of preshocks before the interest-rate change at time T. This study quantitatively relates the size of the market response to the news which caused the shock and uncovers the presence of quantifiable preshocks. We demonstrate that the news associated with interest-rate change is responsible for causing both the anticipation before the announcement and the surprise after the announcement. We estimate the magnitude of financial news using the relative difference between the U.S. Treasury Bill and the Federal Funds effective rate. Our results are consistent with the sign effect, in which bad news has a larger impact than good news.

Particular attention is paid to the issue of unspanned short-run fluctuations in macroeconomic variables and their potentially adverse effect on the specification of external basis models. The author also discusses the challenge of addressing features such as structural breaks and time-varying inflation uncertainty.

By allowing a certain parameter to acquire dynamical behavior we extend the two-factor model to obtain a nonlinear three-factor model that is shown, in a deterministic version, to be equivalent to the Lorenz system of differential equations. With reasonable parameter values the model exhibits chaotic behavior. It successfully emulates certain properties of interest rates including cyclical behavior on a business cycle time scale. Estimation and pricing issues are discussed. Standard PCA techniques used to estimate HJM type models are observed to be equivalent to dimensional estimates commonly applied to 'spatial data' in nonlinear systems analysis.It is concluded that techniques commonly used in the analysis of nonlinear systems may be directly applicable to interest rate models, offering new insights in the development of these models.

Despite the fact that these forecasts play a crucial role in the decision-making process of market participants, little attention has been paid to their evaluation and interpretation. Using half-hourly data from 2011 to 2015 for New South Wales and Queensland, it is shown that the official half-hourly demand forecasts do not satisfy the econometric properties required of rational forecasts. Instead there is a relationship between forecasts and forecast horizon similar to a term structure model of interest rates. To study the term structure of demand forecasts, a factor analysis that uses a small set of latent factors to explain the common variation among multiple observables is implemented. A three-factor model is identified with the factors admitting interpretation as the level, slope and curvature of the term structure of forecasts. The validity of the model is reinforced by assessing the economic value of demand forecasts. It is demonstrated that simple adjustments to long-horizon electricity demand forecasts based on the three estimated factors can enhance the informational content of the official forecasts.;;;;;;;;;1;0;0;0;0;0;1;;;0195-6574;1944-9089;;;;;;;;;;Queensland Univ Technol, Sch Econ & Finance, Brisbane, Qld, AustraliaUniv Melbourne, Dept Econ, Fac Business & Econ, Melbourne, Vic, AustraliaUniv Tasmania, Tasmanian Sch Business & Econ, Hobart, TAS 7001, Australia;;;;2023-11-24;WOS:001095379100002;;

This work contributes to the current debate on central banks having additional objectives over and above control of inflation and output. Three findings emerge. First, the ECB takes financial conditions into account when setting interest rates. Second, amongst Taylor rule models, linear and nonlinear models are empirically indistinguishable within sample, and model specifications with real-time data provide the best description of in-sample ECB interest rate setting behaviour. Third, the 2007-2009 financial crisis witnessed a shift from inflation targeting to output stabilization, and a shift from an asymmetric policy response to financial conditions at high inflation rates to a more symmetric response regardless of the state of inflation. Finally, guidance is provided as regards models for forecasting interest rates in the Eurozone area. Without imposing an a priori choice of the parametric functional form, semiparametric models and autoregressive processes forecast the out-of-sample ECB interest rate setting behaviour better than linear and nonlinear Taylor rule models.

The agent has access to a risk-free asset and a stock in a financial market. But she does not observe perfectly the expected return rate of the stock so she has to estimate this key parameter before making decisions. Besides the general observable financial information, the agent can also acquire a news signal process whose accuracy depends on the agent's attention. We assume that the agent pays limited attention on the signal and she does not trust her estimation model. So it is necessary to consider model ambiguity in this paper as well. The agent maximizes the expected utility of her ter-minal wealth under the worst-case scenario. Under this setting, we derive the robust optimal strategy explicitly. In the presence of the attention and ambiguity aversion, the myopic term of the strategy, the hedging term of the strategy and the worst-case scenario are all changed. We find that more attention makes the variance of the estimated return smaller. The numerical examples also show that a more attentive agent has a better estimation of the unobservable parameter and is more confident on her es-timation. Consequently, the worst-case scenario deviates less from the reference model, which implies a higher expected return rate under the worst-case scenario, thus invests more in the stock.;;;;;;;;;2;0;0;0;0;0;2;;;;2688-1594;;;;;;;;;;Lanzhou Univ, Sch Math & Stat, Lanzhou 730000, Peoples R ChinaSouthern Univ Sci & Technol, Business Sch, Dept Finance, Shenzhen 518055, Peoples R China;;;;2023-05-24;WOS:000980433000001;;

The methods address a fundamental problem faced by forecasters: the most useful model is simple but makes use of all relevant indicators. The results indicate that successful models of recession condition on different economic indicators at different forecast horizons. Predictors that describe real economic activity provide the clearest signal of recession at very short horizons. In contrast, signals from housing and financial markets produce the best forecasts at longer forecast horizons. A real-time forecast experiment explores the predictability of the 2001 and 2007 recessions.

Taking full consideration of the interrelation effects among criteria/variables of the decision model, this paper examined leading semiconductor companies spanning the hottest sectors of integrated circuit (IC) design, wafer foundry, and IC packaging by experts. Empirical findings revealed that risk-free rate was affected by budget deficit, discount rate, and exchange rate; expected market return was affected by country risk, industrial structure, and macroeconomic factors; and beta of the security was affected by firm-specific risk and financial risk. Also, the factors of the CAPM possessed a self-effect relationship according to the DEMATEL technique. In the eight evaluation criteria, macroeconomic criterion was the most important factor affecting investment decisions, followed by exchange rate and firm-specific risk. In portfolio selection, leading companies in the wafer foundry industry outperformed those in IC design and IC packaging, becoming the optimal portfolio of investors during the time that this study was conducted.

I argue that informational frictions and the associated speculative activity may induce prices to drift away from fundamental values, and may result in price booms and busts. Particular attention is given to the interplay between imperfect information about real economic activity, including supply, demand, and inventory accumulation, and speculative activity in oil markets. Furthermore, I present new evidence that there were economically and statistically significant effects of investor flows on futures prices, after controlling for returns in the United States and emerging-economy stock markets, a measure of the balance sheet flexibility of large financial institutions, open interest, the futures/spot basis, and lagged returns on oil futures. The largest impacts on futures prices were from intermediate-term growth rates of index positions and managed-money spread positions. Moreover, my findings suggest that these effects were through risk or informational channels distinct from changes in convenience yield. Finally, the evidence suggests that hedge fund trading in spread positions in futures impacted the shape of term structure of oil futures prices.;;;;;;;;;280;0;0;1;2;1;369;;;0025-1909;1526-5501;;;;;;;;;;Stanford Univ, Grad Sch Business, Stanford, CA 94305 USA;;;;2014-02-01;WOS:000331627900003;;

The abrupt changes of the realized correlation anticipated information of the corresponding option prices. The sovereign default risk, funding liquidity risk, level of risk aversion, and equity market performance are identified to be significant determinants of the option-implied correlation, implying interdependence amongst various markets during the European debt crisis.

Although traditional educational tools in the field of radiology are essential, it is necessary to capitalize on the innovative and emerging educational applications of extended reality (XR) technologies. At the most basic level of learning anatomy, XR has been extensively used with an emphasis on its superiority over conventional learning methods, especially in spatial understanding and recall. For imaging interpretation, XR has fostered the concepts of virtual reading rooms by enabling collaborative learning environments and enhancing image analysis and understanding. Moreover, image-guided interventions in interventional radiology have witnessed an uptick in XR utilization, illustrating its effectiveness in procedural training and skill acquisition for medical students and residents in a safe and risk-free environment. However, there remain several challenges and limitations for XR in radiology education, including technological, economic, and ergonomic challenges and and integration into existing curricula. This review explores the transformative potential of MXR in radiology education and training along with insights on the future of XR in radiology education, forecasting advancements in immersive simulations, artificial intelligence integration for personalized learning, and the potential of cloud-based XR platforms for remote and collaborative training. In summation, MXR's burgeoning role in reshaping radiology education offers a safer, scalable, and more efficient training model that aligns with the dynamic healthcare landscape.;;;;;;;;;6;2;0;0;0;0;12;;;1546-1440;1558-349X;;;;;;;;;;Mass Gen Brigham, Med Extended Real Lab, Innovat & Res, Boston, MA USAOperat Amer Med Extended Real Assoc, Boston, MA USAMassachusetts Gen Hosp, Dept Radiol, 55 Fruit St, Boston, MA 02114 USAHarvard Med Sch, Boston, MA USADuke Univ, Sch Med, Durham, NC USAMass Gen Brigham, Med Extended Real Lab, Boston, MA USADana Farber Canc Inst, Dept Psychosocial Oncol & Palliat Care, Boston, MA USAAmer Med Extended Real Assoc, Boston, MA USAUS Dept Vet Affairs, Off Healthcare Innovat & Learning, Washington, DC USAMassachusetts Gen Hosp, Dept Radiol, Intervent Radiol Res, Boston, MA USA;Operat Amer Med Extended Real AssocAmer Med Extended Real Assoc;;;2024-10-29;WOS:001337781900001;38866067;

Due to the ease in linearizing the model, a grid search or an OLS approach using a fixed shape parameter are popular estimation procedures. The estimated grid search parameters, however, have been reported (1) to behave erratically over time, and (2) to have relatively large variances. On the other hand, parameter estimates based on a fixed shape parameter, while avoiding multicollinearity, turn out to be too smooth.

To consider both wealth and risk and real issues imposed by the financial market, this work proposes a Multiobjective Model Predictive Control strategy with cardinality constraints, besides transaction costs, self-financing, and upper and lower limits. The objective functions are the expected portfolio wealth and the expected Variance and Conditional Value at Risk as the portfolio risk measures. The optimization is performed by a multiobjective genetic algorithm, with operators proposed to control the number of assets in each portfolio and respect the prediction horizon perspective. Finally, an insightful case study is designed using the Brazilian Stock Exchange data in 2019 and 2020. An in-sample analysis explores the relationship between prediction horizon length, cardinality, optimal portfolio composition, risk-free asset, and objective functions on performance. An out-of-sample analysis considers the cumulative wealth, Sharpe ratio, maximum Drawdown, and the monthly accumulated return. Numerical experiments indicate that the proposed strategy outperforms the myopic portfolio selection, beats the primary Brazilian benchmark, a modified Markowitz model, and some top Brazilian investment funds even in crisis times like during the COVID-19 pandemic.;;;;;;;;;4;0;0;0;0;0;4;;;0957-4174;1873-6793;;;;;;;;;;Inst Fed Minas Gerais, Campus Formiga S-N, BR-35577010 Sao Luiz Gonzaga, Formiga, BrazilCtr Fed Educ Tecnol Minas Gerais, Dept Matemat, 7675 Amazonas Av, BR-30510000 Belo Horizonte, MG, BrazilCtr Fed Educ Tecnol Minas Gerais, Dept Comp, 7675 Amazonas Av, BR-30510000 Belo Horizonte, MG, Brazil;Ctr Fed Educ Tecnol Minas GeraisCtr Fed Educ Tecnol Minas Gerais;;;2022-08-11;WOS:000832955500001;;

Using a survey among German firms which regularly queries the firms' assessment of the current willingness of banks to extend credit, we estimate the probability of a restrictive loan supply policy by time taking into account the creditworthiness of borrowers. Creditworthiness is approximated by firm-specific factors, e. g. the firms' assessment of their current business situation and their business expectations. After controlling for the return on the banks' risk-free investment alternative, which is also likely to affect the supply of loans, we derive a credit crunch indicator, which measures that part of the shift in the loan supply that is neither explained by firm-specific factors nor by the opportunity costs of providing risky loans.;;;;;;;;;6;0;0;0;0;0;14;;;0003-6846;;;;;;;;;;;Univ Munich, Leibniz Inst Econ Res, Ifo Inst, D-81679 Munich, GermanyAmberg Weiden Univ Appl Sci, D-92637 Weiden, GermanyUniv Munich, Chair Publ Finance, D-80539 Munich, Germany;Amberg Weiden Univ Appl Sci;;;2012-05-23;WOS:000303583700010;;

This literature focuses almost entirely on short-term rates (under one year to maturity) and long-term rates (ten years or more to maturity). However, almost no attention has been directed at intermediate-term interest rate yields, that is yields on bonds maturing more than one year and less than ten years in the future. Also, this literature essentially ignores the second half of the 1980s and the 1990s. Accordingly, this note empirically investigates the impact of budget deficits in the US on the interest rate yield on three-year US Treasury notes for the period 1960 through the end of 1994. Based on OLS and IV estimates, two of which include net international capital inflows, it is found that budget deficits do raise intermediate-term, rates, which may strengthen arguments that budget deficits lead to crowding out.;;;;;;;;;1;0;0;0;0;0;2;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;1997-11-01;WOS:A1997YG77700013;;

While certainly industrial producers, consumers, and financial investors do have some influence on metal price development, the role of relevant price factors is not yet quite clear. Therefore, in this paper, we examine the explanatory power of various fundamental factors and characteristics known from financial markets, specifically on the expected returns in a unique data sample of 30 metals. We apply-to our knowledge for the first time in this context-the widely accepted method of characteristic-sorted portfolios, extended by the very recent method of two-way portfolio sorts as an alternative to classical multivariate regressions. This mostly nonparametric approach, combined with portfolio aggregation, provides very robust results. Our major finding is that the financial characteristics value and momentum have a very high predictive power for monthly returns of metal portfolios. Metal-specific fundamental factors like stocks, secondary production, apparent consumption, country concentration, mine production, or reserves perform depending on the interpretation moderately well or rather poorly, regarding some economically interpretable transformations and when using multivariate two-way sorts. Hence, from the perspective of expected returns, metals are predominantly assets, while fundamental metal-specific factors still play a non-negligible role. Thus, to a much lesser extent, metals can still be regarded as resources. Overall, the combination of financial characteristics and metal-specific fundamental factors yields the best results. With these robust results, we hope to contribute to a better understanding of metal prices and their underlying factors.;;;;;;;;;10;0;0;0;0;0;11;;;0377-7332;1435-8921;;;;;;;;;;Univ Augsburg, Inst Mat Resource Management, Finance Informat & Resource Management, D-86135 Augsburg, GermanyUniv Augsburg, Res Ctr Finance & Informat Management, Univ Str 12, D-86159 Augsburg, Germany;;;;2017-11-19;WOS:000412446200003;;

This weighting scheme strikes a better balance between the short- and long-maturity bonds during the optimization process. Moreover, by employing four nonlinear optimization algorithms and three parameter initialization approaches, we aim to prevent premature convergence to local optima and improve the quality of fit.

Used by governments and other decision-makers in benefit-cost analysis for over a decade, SC-CO2 estimates draw on climate science, economics, demography and other disciplines. However, a 2017 report by the US National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine(1) (NASEM) highlighted that current SC-CO2 estimates no longer reflect the latest research. The report provided a series of recommendations for improving the scientific basis, transparency and uncertainty characterization of SC-CO2 estimates. Here we show that improved probabilistic socioeconomic projections, climate models, damage functions, and discounting methods that collectively reflect theoretically consistent valuation of risk, substantially increase estimates of the SC-CO2. Our preferred mean SC-CO2 estimate is $185 per tonne of CO2 ($44-$413 per tCO(2): 5%-95% range, 2020 US dollars) at a near-term risk-free discount rate of 2%, a value 3.6 times higher than the US government's current value of $51 per tCO(2). Our estimates incorporate updated scientific understanding throughout all components of SC-CO2 estimation in the new open-source Greenhouse Gas Impact Value Estimator (GIVE) model, in a manner fully responsive to the near-term NASEM recommendations. Our higher SC-CO2 values, compared with estimates currently used in policy evaluation, substantially increase the estimated benefits of greenhouse gas mitigation and thereby increase the expected net benefits of more stringent climate policies.;;;;;;;;;479;6;0;0;85;0;594;;;0028-0836;1476-4687;;;;;;;;;;Resources Future Inc, Washington, DC USAPrinceton Univ, Sch Publ & Int Affairs, Princeton, NJ 08544 USAUniv Calif Berkeley, Energy & Resources Grp, Berkeley, CA 94720 USAEnvironm Protect Agcy, Washington, DC USANYU, Marron Inst Urban Management, Brooklyn, NY USANYU, Grossman Sch Med, New York, NY USAEPRI, Palo Alto, CA USAUniv Calif Davis, Dept Environm Sci & Policy, Davis, CA 95616 USAPrinceton Univ, Dept Econ, Princeton, NJ 08544 USAUniv Washington, Dept Stat, Seattle, WA 98195 USAUniv Washington, Dept Sociol, Seattle, WA 98195 USAUniv Washington, Ctr Stat & Social Sci, Seattle, WA 98195 USARochester Inst Technol, Sch Math Sci, Rochester, NY 14623 USAHarvard Univ, Dept Econ, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA;;;;2022-10-15;WOS:000864575000001;36049503;

In recent years, many authors analyzed this technique from a theoretical and applied point of view.

Three experiments, incorporating 12 treatments and six replications, were analyzed. A generalized, nonlinear equation relating pea yield to accumulated aphid feeding days (AFD) is described. The model approximates two phases of a sigmoid infestation-yield curve. An upper maximum plateau and a region of rapidly decreasing yield are approximate. Beyond 1,800 aFD, a lower minimum yield plateau is hypothesized. Economic injury levels calculated for the 3 years'' experiments using the generalized model were 22.2, 18.2, and 12.2 AFD, respectively.

In this paper we seek to test this claim empirically by developing a novel stochastic trading algorithm in the form of a linear model with a profit maximization objective. Using this method we show improvements over the competitive buy-and-hold baseline over a decade of stock market data for several companies. We further extend the approach to allow for non-stationarity in time, and using multi-task learning to modulate between individual companies and the overall market.

This is testimony to the importance of the term structure (or, equivalently, valuation operator) and to the difficulty of obtaining reliable estimates of it. Until recently, it was not possible to reconcile the theoretical existence of a multiplicity of valuation operators in an incomplete bond market and the empirical nonexistence of even a single one. MacKay and Prisman [Estimating valuation operators in incomplete market with noises: Can noise complete the market. Working paper, 1996] tackle this problem. In this paper, an amendment to and a generalization of their methodology is presented. The amendment preserves the linearity of valuation operators and allows use of efficient linear programming techniques. Further, it facilitates an admissible consideration of the puzzle of negative option prices embedded in bonds. The empirical results presented in this paper were obtained using data on extendable Government of Canada bonds. The results indicate that although the gap between the lowest and the highest prices assigned to a cash flow by different valuation operators is significant, it is not sufficient to resolve the above-mentioned puzzle.

Empirical applications typically rely on some process of discretization so that the system may be estimated with discrete data. This paper introduces a framework for discretizing linear multivariate continuous time systems that includes the commonly used Euler and trapezoidal approximations as special cases and leads to a general class of estimators for the mean reversion matrix. Asymptotic distributions and bias formulae are obtained for estimates of the mean reversion parameter. Explicit expressions are given for the discretization bias and its relationship to estimation bias in both multivariate and in univariate settings. in the univariate context, we compare the performance of the two approximation methods relative to exact maximum likelihood (ML) in terms of bias and variance for the Vasicek process. The bias and the variance of the Euler method are found to be smaller than the trapezoidal method, which are in turn smaller than those of exact ML. Simulations suggest that when the mean reversion is slow, the approximation methods work better than ML, the bias formulae are accurate, and for scalar models the estimates obtained from the two approximate methods have smaller bias and variance than exact ML For the square root process, the Euler method outperforms the Nowman method in terms of both bias and variance. Simulation evidence indicates that the Euler method has smaller bias and variance than exact ML, Nowman's method and the Milstein method. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

The long-term rate responds asymmetrically to changes in the short-term rate, and by less than that is predicted by the benchmark linear model. In particular, a decrease in the short-term rate produces a smaller response in the long-term rate than an increase of the same magnitude. The empirical predictions of the model are examined using data from Japan. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V.

We use this logic to deduce the price of the prepayment option embedded in fixed-rate Government National Mortgage Association (GNMA) mortgage-backed securities. The option price equals the difference between an observed GNMA price and the cost of a synthetic, nonprepayable GNMA constructed from the least expensive portfolio of Treasury securities that exactly replicates the promised GNMA cash flow stream, assuming prepayment is precluded. We regress the option prices on variables found significant in previous prepayment studies, finding that five key regressors explain more than 90% of the prepayment option value in pooled time-series cross-sectional analysis. We also show that the time value of the prepayment option calculated by our method displays a pattern similar to that produced by the Black-Scholes (1973) option pricing model. An additional empirical result is the existence of negative option prices and negative time value of the option prices. We attribute these to the fact that homeowners sometimes exercise their prepayment options when they are out-of-the-money, and to refinancing transaction costs. Our method is independent of assumptions regarding interest rate processes and the homeowner's prepayment behavior, and it provides a benchmark for testing theoretical prepayment models.;;;;;;;;;1;0;0;0;0;0;3;;;1080-8620;;;;;;;;;;;DONALDSON LUFKIN & JENRETTE,NEW YORK,NYCALIF STATE UNIV HAYWARD,DEPT FINANCE,HAYWARD,CA 94542;DONALDSON LUFKIN & JENRETTE;;;1995-03-01;WOS:A1995RJ85800001;;

FOFs investment mainly consists of hedge fund investment and it has two major characteristics which are low correlation against benchmark index and little impact from various external changes in the environment given maximizing return.According to the historical track record of survival hedge funds in this business world, they maintain a stable high return and low risk. However, one must keep in mind that low risk would not be equal to risk free. The failure of Long-term capital management (LTCM) that took place in the summer of 1998 was a symbolized phenomenon. The summer of 1998 exhibited a certain limitation of traditional value at risk (VaR) and some possibility that traditional VaR could be ineffectual to the nonlinear type of fluctuation in the market.In this paper, I try to bring self-organized criticality (SOC) into portfolio risk control. SOC would be well known as a model of decay in the natural world. I analyzed nonlinear type of fluctuation in the market as SOC and applied SOC to capture complicated market movement using threshold point of SOC and risk adjustments by scenario correlation as implicit signals. Threshold becomes the control parameter of risk exposure to set downside floor and forecast extreme nonlinear type of fluctuation under a certain probability. Simulation results would show synergy effect of portfolio risk control between SOC and absolute return strategy. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.

Applied to weekly U.S. data we find significant parameter change over time and strong evidence of non-Gaussian conditional distributions.

Multi-scale estimators similar to that recently proposed by Zhang (2006) can, in fact, be constructed within a simple regression-based approach by exploiting the linear relation existing between the market microstructure bias and the realized volatilities computed at different frequencies. We show how such a powerful multi-scale regression approach can also be applied in the context of the Zhou [Nonlinear Modelling of High Frequency Financial Time Series, pp. 109-123, 1998] or DST orthogonalization of the observed tick-by-tick returns. Providing a natural orthonormal basis decomposition of observed returns, the DST permits the optimal disentanglement of the volatility signal of the underlying price process from the market microstructure noise. The robustness of the DST approach with respect to the more general dependent structure of the microstructure noise is also shown analytically. The combination of the multi-scale regression approach with DST gives a multi-scale DST realized volatility estimator similar in efficiency to the optimal Cramer-Rao bounds and robust against a wide class of noise contamination and model misspecification. Monte Carlo simulations based on realistic models for price dynamics and market microstructure effects show the superiority of DST estimators over alternative volatility proxies for a wide range of noise-to-signal ratios and different types of noise contamination. Empirical analysis based on six years of tick-by-tick data for the S&P 500 index future, FIB 30, and 30 year U.S. Treasury Bond future confirms the accuracy and robustness of DST estimators for different types of real data.;;;;;;;;;12;0;0;0;0;0;14;;;1469-7688;1469-7696;;;;;;;;;;Univ Lugano, CH-6904 Lugano, SwitzerlandSwiss Finance Inst, CH-6904 Lugano, SwitzerlandUniv Pisa, Dept Phys, I-56100 Pisa, Italy;;;;2012-05-02;WOS:000302422400008;;

Unlike existing software packages, we make use of analytical derivatives implemented in efficient C++ code for nonlinear log-likelihood optimization. This allows fast parameter estimation even in higher model dimensions N > 3. The baseline BEKK model is complemented with an asymmetric parameterization that allows for a flexible modeling of conditional (co)variances. Furthermore, we provide the user with the simplified scalar and diagonal BEKK models to deal with high dimensionality of heteroskedastic time series. The package is designed in an object-oriented way featuring a comprehensive toolbox of methods to investigate and interpret, for instance, volatility impulse response functions, risk estimation and forecasting (VaR) and a backtesting algorithm to compare the forecasting performance of alternative BEKK models. For illustrative purposes, we analyze a bivariate ETF return series (S&P, US treasury bonds) and a four-dimensional system comprising, in addition, a gold ETF and changes of a log oil price by means of the suggested package. We find that the BEKKs package is more than 100 times faster for time series systems of dimension N > 3 than other existing packages.;;;;;;;;;1;0;0;0;0;0;1;;;1548-7660;;;;;;;;;;;Univ Gottingen, Fac Econ, Chair Econometr, Humboldtallee 3, D-37073 Gottingen, GermanyCatholic Univ Louvain, Louvain Inst Data Anal & Modelling, Voie Roman Pays 20, B-1348 Louvain La Neuve, Belgium;;;;2024-12-09;WOS:001369045400001;;

The development of LLGMM is motivated by parameter and state estimation problems in continuous-time nonlinear and nonstationary stochastic dynamic model validation problems in biological, chemical, engineering, financial, medical, physical, and social sciences. The byproducts of LLGMM are the balance between model specification and model prescription of continuous-time dynamic process and the development of discrete-time interconnected dynamic model of local sample mean and variance statistic process (DTIDMLSMVSP). DTIDMLSMVSP is the generalization of statistic (sample mean and variance) drawn from the static dynamic population problems.

A second reason, which corresponds to the objective of this paper, is that researchers are currently focusing considerable attention on so-called big data and on new (and old) tools that are available for the analysis of this data. One of the objectives in this field is the assessment of whether big data leads to improvement in forecast accuracy. In this survey paper, we discuss some of the latest (and most interesting) methods currently available for analyzing and utilizing big data when the objective is improved prediction. Our discussion includes a summary of various so-called dimension reduction, shrinkage and machine learning methods as well as a summary of recent tools that are useful for ranking prediction models associated with the implementation of these methods.

In this paper, we study a two-step estimator based on a penalized regression to determine the number of structural breaks, their timing, and estimate the model's coefficients for each regime. We focus on two important cases, namely, (i) constant dynamics but changing long-run equilibria, and (ii) convergence to new long-run equilibria with new adjustment dynamics. We use simulations to investigate the finite sample performance of the two-step estimator and provide an empirical illustration using data on the term structure of interest rates.;;;;;;;;;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;;;1081-1826;1558-3708;;;;;;;;;;Univ Hohenheim, Core Facil Hohenheim, Schloss Hohenheim 1 C, D-70593 Stuttgart, GermanyUniv Hohenheim, Inst Econ, Schloss Hohenheim 1 C, D-70593 Stuttgart, GermanyUniv Hohenheim, Stuttgart, Germany;;;;2025-08-14;WOS:001544671300001;;

We design the conditional probability of defaults for the CDS prices based on the Hawkes-diffusion process and obtain the theoretical prices of CDS indexes. To estimate the model parameters, we calibrate the model prices to empirical prices obtained from individual sovereign CDS term structure data. The estimated parameters clearly explain both cross-sectional and time-series data. Our empirical results show that the probability of a huge loss event sharply increased during the Eurozone debt crisis, indicating a contagion effect. Even countries with strong and stable economies, such as Germany and France, suffered from the contagion effect. We also find that the probability of small events is sensitive to the state of the economy, spiking several times due to the global financial crisis and the Greek government debt crisis.

The focus is not on the estimation of credit models including jumps, but on the automatic detection of masked multiple outliers in multivariate time series. Both simulated and real market credit spread time series are analyzed. In order to make inference on outliers, confidence envelopes which are virtually independent of the estimated parameters are introduced. The output is not only a unique default intensity term structure curve, as often used in the financial literature, but a robust confidence interval within which default intensity is likely to stay.

Regime switches are attributed to structural changes in an hidden economic environment and are described by a continuous-time, finite-state, unobservable Markov chain. The model is then applied to the valuation of a standard European option. By means of the standard separation principle, filtering and option valuation problems are separated. Robust filters for the hidden states of the economy and their robust filtered estimates of unknown parameters from the expectation maximization algorithm are presented based on standard techniques in filtering theory. Then an explicit expression of a conditional characteristic function relevant to option pricing is presented and the valuation of the option is discussed using the inverse Fourier transformation approach. Using the limiting behavior of the conditional characteristic function, an efficient implementation of the transform inversion integral is considered. Numerical experiments are given to illustrate the flexibility of filtering algorithms and the significance of regime-switching in option pricing.;;;;;;;;;7;1;0;0;0;0;10;;;0927-7099;1572-9974;;;;;;;;;;Southeast Univ, Sch Management & Econ, Nanjing, Jiangsu, Peoples R ChinaUniv Hong Kong, Dept Math, Adv Modeling & Appl Comp Lab, Pokfulam, Pokfulam Rd, Hong Kong, Peoples R ChinaHughes Hall,Wollaston Rd, Cambridge, EnglandBeijing Univ Chem Technol, Sch Econ & Management, North Third Ring Rd, Beijing, Peoples R ChinaMacquarie Univ, Fac Business & Econ, Dept Appl Finance & Actuarial Studies, Sydney, NSW 2109, Australia;;;;2019-02-27;WOS:000458498000004;;

Based on a review of the advantages and disadvantages of different volatility models, we find that the Heston stochastic volatility model with an adaptive correlation coefficient is most suitable for analysing the Hong Kong options market. We subsequently propose a model-free implied volatility term structure formulated using options with different strikes and different maturities. The implied volatility is calculated by integrating the option price and strike price from the current time to the expiry date. Discrete points of term structure data are used to fit a term structure curve. Finally, we use the model-free implied volatility term structure as the long-run mean level of the Heston model to fully exploit the information content contained in the implied volatility term structure. We simulate the distribution of the underlying asset price based on the Heston model and constant elasticity of variance (CEV) model. The adaptive correlation Heston model provides superior results in terms of one-day-ahead prediction performance and the 79-day distribution of the underlying asset price compared with the CEV model.;;;;;;;;;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;;;1076-9307;1099-1158;;;;;;;;;;Jiangxi Univ Finance & Econ, Sch Finance, Nanchang, Jiangxi, Peoples R ChinaJiangxi Univ Finance & Econ, Res Ctr Financial Management & Risk Prevent, Nanchang, Jiangxi, Peoples R ChinaShenzhen Univ, Coll Econ, Shenzhen, Peoples R ChinaCity Univ Hong Kong, Dept Management Sci, Hong Kong, Peoples R China;;;;2020-08-27;WOS:000560374400001;;

In this estimation, general systematic market factors, such as the rate of return on the S&P500 stock index and yields on a constant maturity 5-year Treasury note, are held constant such that the exposure variables are accounting for effects due to banks' exposure to emerging market debt. The results, although not uniform among banking companies, support the hypothesis that the extent of exposure to emerging market debt are factored into the valuation of banking company equity contemporaneously. The inclusion of a market value indicator adds to the explanation of equity returns of some banks. It is also clear that knowing the extent of the exposure on a book value basis is important information alone that may allow investors to take account of or evaluate the effects of changes in banking company equity valuation from LDC debt exposures. We also perform an event study for three major debt crises to determine whether the market recognizes the effects of these events on bank valuation. The event study results show that there is little information from identifying the time period of the crises on banking company equity returns. Explanations for this are that the information of these possible crises has been embedded in bank changes in exposure and that the market valuation of the emerging market debt is already accounted for by our model.

This method appears well suited for econometric models where the structural relationships of interest define the observed endogenous variables as a known function of unobserved state variables and unknown parameters. This nonlinear state-space specification paves the way for iterative or recursive EM-like strategies. In the E steps, the state variables are forecasted given the observations and a value of the parameters. In the M steps, these forecasts are used to deduce estimators of the unknown parameters from the statistical model of latent variables. The proposed iterative/recursive estimation is particularly useful for latent regression models and for dynamic equilibrium models involving latent state variables.

Finally, we relax the symmetric hypothesis in asset return predictability based on a non-parametric non-linear approach: the projection pursuit regression model. Our study reveals three main findings. First, we reject all previous findings supporting a standard model of asset return predictability that is valuable for all countries, as we show that each country has specific domestic factors (both macroeconomic and financial) useful to predict future returns. Second, our empirical framework shows that asset return predictability might be robustly modelled based on non-linear specification based on the projection pursuit regression model.

In this approach, an investment model is considered where the agent decides at every time step the proportion of wealth to invest in a risky asset, keeping the rest of the budget in a risk-free asset. Every investment is evaluated in the market via stylized return on investment function (RoI), which is modeled by a stochastic process with unknown periodicities and levels of noise. For comparison, two reference strategies are presented which represent the case of agents with zero knowledge and complete knowledge of the dynamics of the returns. An investment strategy based on technical analysis to forecast the next return is also considered. To account for the performance of the different strategies, some computer experiments are performed to calculate the average budget that can be obtained with them over a certain number of time steps. To assure fair comparisons, the parameters of each strategy are first tuned for budget maximization. Afterward, the performance of these strategies is compared for RoI's with different periodicities and levels of noise.;;;;;International Conference on Econophysics Colloquium and BeyondInternational Conference on Econophysics Colloquium and Beyond;SEP 27-29, 2007SEP 27-29, 2007;;Ancona, ITALYAncona, ITALY;0;0;0;0;0;0;1;;;0219-5259;1793-6802;;;;;;;;;;Humboldt Univ, Dept Comp Sci, D-10099 Berlin, Germany;;;;2008-10-01;WOS:000261389300008;;

However, the existence of chaos in shipping freight rates remains an open and outstanding matter as previous research used methodology that can produce misleading results. Using daily data, this paper aims to unveil the nonlinear dynamics of the Baltic Dry Index that has been proposed as a measure of the shipping rates for certain raw materials. We tested for the existence of nonlinearity and low-dimensional chaos. We have also examined the chaotic dynamics throughout three sub-sampling periods, which have been determined by the volatility pattern of the series. For this purpose, from a comprehensive view we apply several metric and topological techniques, including the most suitable methods for noisy time series analysis. The proposed methodology considers the characteristics of chaotic time series, such as nonlinearity, determinism, sensitivity to initial conditions, fractal dimension and recurrence. Although there is strong evidence of a nonlinear structure, a chaotic and, therefore, deterministic behavior cannot be assumed during the whole or the three periods considered. Our findings indicate that the generalized autoregressive conditional heteroscedastic (GARCH) model and exponential GARCH (EGARCH) model explain a significant part of the nonlinear structure that is found in the dry bulk shipping freight market.;;;;;;;;;5;0;0;0;0;0;5;;;;2227-7390;;;;;;;;;;Univ Complutense Madrid, Med Fac, Dept Stat & Operat Res, Plaza Ramon y Cajal S-N,Ciudad Univ, Madrid 28040, SpainUniv Cantabria, Dept Econ, Santander 39005, Spain;;;;2021-09-18;WOS:000694403500001;;

The advantage of using this approach is that it allows for a nonlinear relationship between these variables depending on the level of consumption. We estimate the coefficients using a Phillips-Hansen type fully modified quantile estimator to correct for the presence of endogeneity in the cointegrating relationship. To test for the null of cointegration at each quantile, we apply a quantile CUSUM test. Results show that: (i) consumption is more sensitive to changes in labor income than to changes in asset wealth for the entire distribution of consumption, (ii) the elasticity of consumption with respect to labor income (asset wealth) is larger at the right (left) tail of the consumption distribution than at the left (right) tail, (iii) the series are cointegrated around the median, but not in the tails of the distribution of consumption, (iv) using the estimated cay obtained for the right (left) tail of the distribution of consumption improves the long-run (short-run) forecast ability on real excess stock returns over a risk-free rate.;;;;;;;;;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;;;1081-1826;1558-3708;;;;;;;;;;Univ Chicago, Kenneth C Griffin Dept Econ, Chicago, IL 60637 USACent Reserve Bank Peru, Econ Studies, Lima, Peru;Cent Reserve Bank Peru;;;2022-01-12;WOS:000739615400001;;

In this paper we quantify how empirically calibrated model errors concerning the futures term structure affect the valuation and hedging of natural gas storage. We find that even small model errors-on the order of 1%-2% of the empirical futures price variance-can have a disproportionate impact on storage valuation and hedging. In particular, theoretically equivalent hedging strategies have very different sensitivities to model error, with one natural strategy exhibiting potentially catastrophic performance in the presence of small model errors. We propose effective approaches to mitigate the negative effect of futures term-structure model error on hedging, also taking into account futures contract illiquidity, and provide theoretical justification for some of these approaches. Beyond commodity storage, our analysis has relevance for other real and financial options that depend on futures term-structure dynamics, as well as for inventory, production, and capacity investment policies that rely on demand-forecast term structures.;;;;;;;;;23;0;0;0;0;0;32;;;1523-4614;1526-5498;;;;;;;;;;Carnegie Mellon Univ, Tepper Sch Business, Pittsburgh, PA 15213 USAUniv Texas Austin, McCombs Sch Business, Austin, TX 78712 USA;;;;2015-06-01;WOS:000357888700003;;

We estimated the cost effectiveness of BRCA mutation testing in early-stage breast cancer patients with high pre-test probability of harbouring the mutation in Malaysia, an LMIC in Asia.Methods We developed a decision analytic model to estimate the lifetime costs and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) accrued through BRCA mutation testing or routine clinical surveillance (RCS) for a hypothetical cohort of 1000 early-stage breast cancer patients aged 40 years. In the model, patients would decide whether to accept testing and to undertake risk-reducing mastectomy, oophorectomy, tamoxifen, combinations or neither. We calculated the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) from the health system perspective. A series of sensitivity analyses were performed.Results In the base case, testing generated 11.2 QALYs over the lifetime and cost US$4815 per patient whereas RCS generated 11.1 QALYs and cost US$4574 per patient. The ICER of US$2725/QALY was below the cost-effective thresholds. The ICER was sensitive to the discounting of cost, cost of BRCA mutation testing and utility of being risk-free, but the ICERs remained below the thresholds. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis showed that at a threshold of US$9500/QALY, 99.9% of simulations favoured BRCA mutation testing over RCS.Conclusions Offering BRCA mutation testing to early-stage breast cancer patients identified using a locally-validated risk-assessment tool may be cost effective compared to RCS in Malaysia.;;;;;;;;;13;0;0;0;4;0;16;;;1175-5652;1179-1896;;;;;;;;;;Duke NUS Med Sch, Hlth Syst & Serv Res, 8 Coll Rd, Singapore 169857, SingaporeNatl Clin Res Ctr, Healthcare Stat Unit, 3rd Floor,MMA House,124 Jalan Pahang, Kuala Lumpur 53000, MalaysiaSubang Jaya Med Ctr, Canc Res Malaysia, Outpatient Ctr, 2nd Floor, Subang Jaya 47500, Selangor, MalaysiaUniv Malaya, Dept Surg, Fac Med, Kuala Lumpur 50603, MalaysiaUniv Malaya, Dept Pharm, Fac Med, Kuala Lumpur 50603, MalaysiaUniv Malaya, Julius Ctr, Dept Social & Prevent Med, Fac Med, Kuala Lumpur 50603, MalaysiaUniv Malaya, Dept Obstet & Gynaecol, Fac Med, Kuala Lumpur 50603, MalaysiaUniv Malaya, Dept Paediat, Fac Med, Kuala Lumpur 50603, MalaysiaNaresuan Univ, CPOR, Dept Pharm Practice, Fac Pharmaceut Sci, Muang, Phitsanulok, ThailandMonash Univ Malaysia, Sch Pharm, Subang Jaya 47500, Selangor, MalaysiaMonash Univ Malaysia, Asian Ctr Evidence Synth Populat Implementat & Cl, Hlth & Well Being Cluster, Global Asia 21st Century Platform GA21, Subang Jaya 47500, Selangor, MalaysiaUniv Wisconsin, Sch Pharm, Madison, WI 53706 USA;Natl Clin Res CtrSubang Jaya Med Ctr;;;2018-12-28;WOS:000431805900011;29572724;

We control for widely-studied standard predictors and use out-of-sample metrics to assess forecast performance. We find that war-related uncertainty is among the top five predictors of recessions at three different forecast horizons (3, 6, and 12 months). The predictive value of war-related uncertainty has fallen in the second half of the 20th century. Uncertainty regarding the state of securities markets has gained in relative importance. The probability of a recession is a nonlinear function of war-related and securities-markets uncertainty. Receiver-operating-characteristic curves show that uncertainty improves out-of-sample forecast performance at the longer forecast horizons. A dynamic version of the BRT approach sheds light on the importance of various lags of government-related uncertainty for recession forecasting at the long forecast horizon.;;;;;;;;;23;0;0;0;2;0;23;;;1081-1826;1558-3708;;;;;;;;;;Univ Bundeswehr Hamburg, Helmut Schmidt Univ, Hamburg, GermanyUniv Pretoria, Dept Econ, Pretoria, South Africa;;;;2021-01-05;WOS:000600062700005;;

Applying newly extended Glosten-Jagannathan-Runkle generalized autoregressive conditional heteroscedasticity models, we supply the following new evidence. First, we find that incorporating structural breaks is always effective in estimating banking stock volatilities. Second, we clarify that structural breaks partially explain the tail fatness of banking stock returns. Third, we find that when incorporating structural breaks, the estimated volatilities more accurately capture their downside risk, proving that structural breaks matter for risk management. Fourth, our news impact curve and model parameter analyses also uncover that when incorporating structural breaks, the asymmetry in volatility responses to return shocks is more accurately captured. This proves why the estimated volatilities by incorporating structural breaks better explain downside risk. In addition, we further reveal that the estimated volatilities obtained through incorporating structural breaks increase sharply during momentous events such as the Lehman crisis, the European debt crisis, Brexit, and the recent COVID-19 crisis. Moreover, we also clarify that the volatility spreads between models with and without structural breaks rise during the Lehman and COVID-19 crises.

MSVAR models are perfectly suited for such analyses because they combine gradual movements with sudden regime switches. In this paper, we develop a comprehensive methodology to conduct these analyses. We derive first and second moments conditional only on the regime distribution and propose impulse response functions for both moments. By formulating the MSVAR as an extended linear non-Gaussian VAR, all results are available in closed-form. We illustrate our methods with an application to stock and bond return predictability. We show how forecasts of means, volatilities and (auto-)correlations depend on the regimes. The effect of shocks becomes highly nonlinear, and they propagate via different channels.

In this paper, we obtain two expressions to approximate the bias of the least squares/maximum likelihood estimator of the mean reversion parameter in the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process with a known long run mean when discretely sampled data are available. The first expression mimics the bias formula of Marriott and Pope (1954) for the discrete time model. Simulations show that this expression does not work satisfactorily when the speed of mean reversion is slow. Slow mean reversion corresponds to the near unit root situation and is empirically realistic for financial time series. An improvement is made in the second expression where a nonlinear correction term is included into the bias formula. It is shown that the nonlinear term is important in the near unit root situation. Simulations indicate that the second expression captures the magnitude, the curvature and the non-monotonicity of the actual bias better than the first expression. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

Although substantial research efforts have been made to develop effective methods, it is still a challenge to infer unknown parameters in SDE models from observations that may have large variations. Using an interest rate model as a test problem, in this work we use the Bayesian inference and Markov Chain Monte Carlo method to estimate unknown parameters in SDE models.;;;;;;;;;3;0;0;0;0;0;3;;;1024-123X;1563-5147;;;;;;;;;;Monash Univ, Sch Math Sci, Melbourne, Vic 3800, AustraliaZhongnan Univ Econ & Law, Sch Finance, Wuhan 430073, Peoples R ChinaCurtin Univ, Dept Math & Stat, Perth, WA 6845, AustraliaWuhan Yangtze Business Univ, Wuhan 430065, Peoples R China;Wuhan Yangtze Business Univ;;;2014-05-11;WOS:000333629300001;;

A structural model is proposed that allows interest rates to be stochastic and provides closed-form expressions for the market value of a firm's equity and its probability of default. This model is embedded within the integrated framework and the general approach illustrated by measuring the risk of a foreign exchange forward when there is a significant probability of default by the counterparty.

Amino acid side chains located near the capsid intersubunit interfaces and either predicted or found to be dispensable for infectivity were replaced by others that could establish new disulfide bonds or electrostatic interactions between subunits. Two engineered viruses were normally infectious, genetically stable, and antigenically indistinguishable from the natural virus but showed substantially increased stability against irreversible dissociation. Electrostatic interactions mediated this stabilizing effect. For foot-and-mouth disease virus and other viruses, some evidence had suggested that an increase in virion stability could be linked to an impairment of infectivity. The results of the present study show, in fact, that virion thermostability against dissociation into subunits may not be selectively constrained by functional requirements for infectivity. The thermostable viruses obtained, and others similarly engineered, could be used for the production, using current procedures, of foot-and-mouth disease vaccines that are less dependent on a faultless cold chain. In addition, introduction of those stabilizing mutations in empty (nucleic acid-free) capsids could facilitate the production of infectionrisk-free vaccines against the disease, one of the economically most important animal diseases worldwide.;;;;;;;;;84;6;0;0;65;0;99;;;0022-538X;1098-5514;;;;;;;;;;Univ Autonoma Madrid, Ctr Biol Mol Severo Ochoa, CSIC, E-28049 Madrid, Spain;;;;2008-12-15;WOS:000261164000024;18829763;

When using price errors, objective function in term structure estimation is a nonlinear function of the model parameters. This necessarily entails using numerical optimization techniques for estimation, which brings to fore the issue of (sensitivity of final results to) the choice of initialization of the optimization routine. This study assesses the sensitivity of the final objective function value and the final parameter vector to the choice of the 'initial guess' during the estimation of the popular Nelson-Siegel model. It turns out that there exist regions in the shape of the objective function where a slight change in (seemingly reasonable) initial vector takes one far from optimum. Choice of the (range of) 'best' starting vector turns out to be an empirical matter. Grid search is recommended. One must first get to a subset of initial values that results in the objective function value near a minimum and then assess the sensitivity of the final parameter vector to those relevant (subset of) initial values. The study illustrates the process using a typical trading day's data.;;;;;;;;;5;0;0;0;0;0;5;;;1350-4851;;;;;;;;;;;Indian Inst Management, Dept Finance & Accounting, Ahmadabad 380015, Gujarat, India;;;;2012-05-09;WOS:000302502800010;;

The test is based on a new kind of multivariate empirical process of contemporaneous and lagged probability integral transforms. We establish weak convergence of the process under parameter uncertainty and local alternatives. We justify a parametric bootstrap approximation that accounts for parameter estimation effects often ignored in practice.

The spread linearly predicts one-year-ahead real growth in nine industrial production sectors of the USA and four of the UK over the last 40 years. However, recent investigations on the spread-real activity relation have questioned both its linear nature and its time-invariant framework. Our in-sample empirical evidence suggests that the spread-real activity relationship exhibits asymmetries that allow for different predictive power of the spread when past spread values were above or below some threshold value. We then measure the out-of-sample forecast performance of the nonlinear model using predictive accuracy tests. The results show that significant improvement in forecasting accuracy, at least for one-step-ahead forecasts, can be obtained over the linear model.

It applies the realized stochastic volatility model (Takahashi, Omori, & Watanabe, 2009, and Koopman & Scharth, 2013) to the spot rate model with dynamic drift and level effect setups (RSVL). A jointly approximated maximum likelihood procedure is used to estimate this model. The simulation results show that the RSVL model can be consistently estimated and noise-and-jump-robust realized volatility measures improve the accuracy of the estimation. This study empirically investigates the Chinese interbank repo market with RSVL model, which manifested the advantage of taking the level effect and nonlinear drift into consideration. The noise-and-jump-robust realized volatility measures (e.g. subsample realized volatility and threshold pre-average realized volatility) decrease the volatility fitting error. The nonparametric testing suggests that the RSVL model with noise-and-jump-robust realized volatility measures has more power on forecasting excess kurtosis and fat tails and predicting dynamics of higher order autocorrelations.

The model can be applied when the borrower's ex ante expectation of his tenure follows any probability distribution bounded to the left at zero. The Gamma distribution is used to illustrate the model.The pricing model is further applied to determine the conditions under which financially motivated prepayment is optimal. The results show that the certainty model understates the Interest Rate Differential needed to justify prepayment (IRD) for short Expected Holding Period (EHP) borrowers and overstates the IRD for long EHP borrowers. When the EHP is relatively long, the certainty model provides relatively good estimates of IRD during the beginning years of the mortgage life.

The purpose of developing the framework is twofold: (1) to draw attention to important yet under-researched aspects of ethical decision-making, and (2) to increase our understanding of the psychology of committing fraud. Our framework builds on the existing fraud triangle (PCAOB, Consideration of fraud in a financial statement audit. AU Section 316, www.pcaobus.org, 2005) which is used by auditors to assess fraud risk. The fraud triangle is composed of three factors that, together, predict the likelihood of fraud within an organization: opportunity, incentive/pressure, and attitude/rationalization. We find that, when faced with the opportunity and incentive/pressure, there are three psychological pathways to fraud nestled within attitude/rationalization: (1) lack of awareness, (2) intuition coupled with rationalization, and (3) reasoning. These distinctions are important for fraud prevention because each of these paths is driven by a different psychological mechanism. This framework is useful in a number of ways. First, it identifies certain insidious situational factors in which individuals commit fraud without recognizing it. Second, it extends our knowledge of rationalization by theorizing that individuals use rationalization to avoid or reduce the negative affect that accompanies performing an unethical behavior. Negative affect is important because individuals wish to avoid it. Third, it identifies several other methods fraudsters use to reduce negative affect, each of which could serve as potential psychological red flags and helps predict future fraudulent behavior. Finally, our framework can be used as a theoretical foundation to explore several interventions designed to prevent fraud.";;;;;;;;;189;1;0;0;2;1;335;;;0167-4544;;;;;;;;;;;Queens Univ, Kingston, ON K7L 3N6, Canada;;;;2011-07-01;WOS:000293137200006;;

This parametrization results from letting the volatility function depend on time to maturity and on two factors: the instantaneous spot rate and one fixed-maturity for-ward rate. Our main purpose is an estimation methodology for which we have to model the observations under the historical probability measure. This leads us to consider as an additional third factor the market price of interest rate risk, that connects the historical and the HJM martingale measures. Assuming that the information comes from noisy observations of the fixed-maturity forward rate, the purpose is to estimate recursively, on the basis of this information, the three Markovian factors as well as the parameters in the model, in particular those in the volatility function. This leads to a nonlinear filtering problem, for the solution of which we describe an approximation methodology. based on time discretization and quantization.

We propose a simple density estimate that is particularly useful for studying the stationary density of nonlinear time series models. Under a general dependence structure, we establish the root it consistency of the proposed density estimate. For parameter estimation, a Bahadur type representation is obtained for the conditional maximum likelihood estimate. The parameter estimate is shown to be asymptotically efficient in the sense that its limiting variance attains the Cramer-Rao lower bound. The performance of our density estimate is studied by simulations. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

In order to manage the risk borne by annuity providers, one needs to take into account all sources of uncertainty that affect the value of future obligations under the contract. In this paper, we define the concept of annuity rate as the conditional expected present value random variable of future payments of the annuity, given the future dynamics of its risk factors. The annuity rate deals with the non-diversifiable systematic risk contained in the life annuity contract, and it involves mortality risk as well as investment risk. While it is plausible to assume that there is no correlation between the two risks, each affects the annuity rate through a combination of dependent random variables. In order to understand the probabilistic profile of the annuity rate, we apply cornonotonicity theory to approximate its quantile function. We also derive accurate upper and lower bounds for prediction intervals for annuity rates. We use the Lee Carter model for mortality risk and the Vasicek model for the term structure of interest rates with an annually renewable fixed-income investment policy. Different investment strategies can be handled using this framework. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

To this end, a number of rigorous tests are applied on the returns, based on four major daily indices of the Indian stock market. It is found that the Indian stock market is predictable, and this observed lack of efficiency is due to serial correlation, nonlinear dependence, day-of-the week effects, parameter instability, conditional heteroskedasticity (GARCH), daily-level seasonality in volatility, the short-term interest rate (in some subperiods of some indices), and some dynamics in the higher-order moments.;;;;;;;;;8;0;0;0;0;0;11;;;1540-496X;1558-0938;;;;;;;;;;Indian Stat Inst, Kolkata 700035, W Bengal, IndiaShyampur Siddheswari Coll, Ajodhya, Howrah, India;Shyampur Siddheswari Coll;;;2005-11-01;WOS:000235745100002;;

To achieve significant dimension reduction while preserving the intrinsic matrix structure and temporal dynamics in such data, Wang, Liu, and Chen proposed a matrix factor model, that is, shown to be able to provide effective analysis. In this article, we establish a general framework for incorporating domain and prior knowledge in the matrix factor model through linear constraints. The proposed framework is shown to be useful in achieving parsimonious parameterization, facilitating interpretation of the latent matrix factor, and identifying specific factors of interest. Fully utilizing the prior-knowledge-induced constraints results in more efficient and accurate modeling, inference, dimension reduction as well as a clear and better interpretation of the results. Constrained, multi-term, and partially constrained factor models for matrix-variate time series are developed, with efficient estimation procedures and their asymptotic properties. We show that the convergence rates of the constrained factor loading matrices are much faster than those of the conventional matrix factor analysis under many situations. Simulation studies are carried out to demonstrate finite-sample performance of the proposed method and its associated asymptotic properties. We illustrate the proposed model with three applications, where the constrained matrix-factor models outperform their unconstrained counterparts in the power of variance explanation under the out-of-sample 10-fold cross-validation setting. for this article are available online.;;;;;;;;;63;5;0;0;1;0;74;;;0162-1459;1537-274X;;;;;;;;;;Princeton Univ, Dept Operat Res & Financial Engn, Princeton, NJ 08544 USAUniv Chicago, Booth Sch Business, Chicago, IL 60637 USARutgers State Univ, Dept Stat, Piscataway, NJ 08854 USA;;;;2019-04-25;WOS:000470626900001;;

In particular, several methods have been proposed of how to model and price participating policies, which are characterized by an annual interest rate guarantee and some bonus distribution rules. However, despite the long terms of life insurance products, most valuation models allowing for sophisticated bonus distribution rules and the inclusion of frequently offered options assume a simple Black-Scholes setup and, more specifically, deterministic or even constant interest rates.We present a framework in which participating life insurance contracts including predominant kinds of guarantees and options can be valuated and analyzed in a stochastic interest rate environment. In particular, the different option elements can be priced and analyzed separately. We use Monte Carlo and discretization methods to derive the respective values.The sensitivity of the contract and guarantee values with respect to multiple parameters is studied using the bonus distribution schemes as introduced in [Bauer, D., Kiesel, R., Kling, A., Russ, J., 2006. Risk-neutral valuation of participating life insurance contracts. Insurance: Math. Econom. 39, 171-183]. Surprisingly, even though the value of the contract as a whole is only moderately affected by the stochasticity of the short rate of interest, the value of the different embedded options is altered considerably in comparison to the value under constant interest rates. Furthermore, using a simplified asset portfolio and empirical parameter estimations, we show that the proportion of stock within the insurer's asset portfolio substantially affects the value of the contract.

Sooner rather than later, much greater longevity would be possible for us due to artificial intelligence advances in health care. Similarly, Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) in highly automated vehicles may reduce or even eventually eliminate accidents by perceiving dangerous situations, which would minimize the number of accidents and lead to fewer loss claims for insurance companies. To model the survivor function capturing greater longevity as well as the number of claims reflecting less accidents in the long run, in this paper, we study a Cox process whose intensity process is piecewise-constant and decreasing. We derive its ultimate distributional properties, such as the Laplace transform of intensity integral process, the probability generating function of point process, their associated moments and cumulants, and the probability of no more claims for a given time point.

The resulting Bayesian additive vector autoregressive tree (BAVART) model is capable of capturing arbitrary nonlinear relations between the endogenous variables and the covariates without much input from the researcher. Since controlling for heteroscedasticity is key for producing precise density forecasts, our model allows for stochastic volatility in the errors. We apply our model to two datasets. The first application shows that the BAVART model yields highly competitive forecasts of the U.S. term structure of interest rates.

Despite the flexibility of and the notable advances in theoretical research about the HJM model, the number of empirical studies of it is still very sparse. This paucity is principally due to the difficulties in estimating models in this class, which are not only high-dimensional, but also nonlinear and involve latent state variables. The estimation of a fairly broad class of HJM models as a nonlinear filtering problem is undertaken by adopting the local linearization filter, which is known to have some desirable statistical and numerical features, so enabling the estimation of the model via the maximum likelihood method. The estimator is then applied to the US, the UK and the Australian markets. Different two- and three-factor models are found to be the best for each market, with the factors being the level, the slope and the twist effect. The contribution of each factor towards overall variability of the interest rates and the financial reward each factor claims are found to differ considerably from one market to another.

It is shown that accounting for the long-run equilibrium dynamic between these variables is essential to correctly explain credit spread changes. Using a novel structural model in which equity is modeled as a compound option on the firm's assets, a new methodology for estimating the unobservable market value of the firm's assets and volatility is developed. The proposed model allows to significantly reduce the pricing errors in predicting credit spreads when compared with several structural models. In terms of correlation analysis, it is shown that not accounting for the long-run equilibrium equation embedded in an error correction mechanism (ECM) results into a misspecification problem when regressing a set of explanatory variables onto the spread changes. Once credit spreads, leverage and volatility are correctly modeled, thus allowing for a long-run equilibrium, the fit of the regressions sensibly increases if compared to the results of previous research. It is further shown that most of the cross-sectional variation of the spreads appears to be more driven by firm-specific characteristics rather than systematic factors.;;;;;;;;;2;0;0;0;0;0;2;;;;2079-3197;;;;;;;;;;Scuola Normale Super Pisa, Fac Sci, Quantitat Finance Res Grp, Piazza Cavalieri 7, I-56126 Pisa, Italy;;;;2022-09-01;WOS:000858213200001;;

Both investment-grade and high-yield bond returns can be predicted by past stock market returns in-sample and out-of-sample, and the predictive relation is much stronger between stocks and high-yield bonds. By contrast, there is little evidence that stock returns can be predicted by past bond returns.

The structural break threshold VAR (SBTVAR) predicts better the timing of recessions than models with constant threshold or with only a break.

There are many empirical evidences supporting that the data generating process governing dynamics of many economics variables might vary over time because of economic climate changes or time effects. One possible way to explain the time-dependent dynamics of state variables is to model the drift or volatility terms as functions of time t as well as state variables. A way to find closed-form likelihood expansion for a multivariate time-homogeneous diffusion has been developed by Ait-Sahalia (2008). This research is built on his work and extends his results to time-inhomogeneous cases. We conduct Monte Carlo simulation studies to examine performance of the approximate transition density function when it is used to obtain ML estimates. The results reveal that our method yields a very accurate approximate likelihood function, which can be a good candidate when the true likelihood function is unavailable as is often the case.

However, the local polynomial kernel estimators are not consistent at points where the volatility function has a break. The estimator presented in this paper generalises the classical local linear (LL).

This misalignment seems to have been substantial in recent times, featuring a low correlation between inflation and the policy rate. This empirical evidence motivates an alternative explanation, based on uncertainty rather than risk, of the bond term premium measures found in the literature. This paper estimates an expectational term premium driven by misaligned short-term interest rate expectations from a behavioral DSGE model that introduces model uncertainty by assuming adaptive learning with discretionary beliefs. The estimated 10-year expectational term premium shares important features with the corresponding term premium measures obtained using no-arbitrage affine term structure models. Thus, the expectational term premium is sizable, highly persistent, mildly countercyclical, and highly correlated with those term premium measures in the most recent period studied. In short, a potential misalignment of short-term interest expectations with inflation expectations provides an important channel for explaining the bond premium lately.;;;;;;;;;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;;;1062-9408;1879-0860;;;;;;;;;;Univ Basque Country, UPV EHU, Leioa, Spain;;;;2025-05-26;WOS:001492652200001;;

The method is designed for continuous repetitive use and is consistent with work by Diebold and Li, providing reasonable extrapolated rates, with an appropriate level of volatility over time. The Svensson model is adopted, and its parameters are estimated by the combination of a genetic algorithm and a quasi-Newton nonlinear optimization method. We innovate with a new objective function that focuses on both parts of the estimated curves (interpolated and extrapolated). For this purpose, a stability component is added. The new objective function aims to solve the problem of estimating long-term rates not observable in the market, for which the estimates are usually artificially stable or excessively volatile. The results show that the estimation method is able to bring the volatility of extrapolated rates to levels consistent with those observed for the longest liquid rate. Estimation errors are small enough and there is no statistical evidence that they are biased. The method is useful for the insurance market, since it provides interest rates that do not lead to artificially stable or excessively volatile technical provisions.;;;;;;;;;2;0;0;0;0;0;2;;;1092-0277;2325-0453;;;;;;;;;;Brazilian Insurance Supervisor SUSEP, BR-21941901 Rio De Janeiro, BrazilFed Univ Rio de Janeiro UFRJ, COPPEAD Grad Sch Business, Rio De Janeiro, BrazilEdhed Risk Inst, Rio De Janeiro, BrazilBrazilian Sch Insurance ENS, Rio De Janeiro, BrazilRio de Janeiro State Univ UERJ, Rio De Janeiro, Brazil;Brazilian Insurance Supervisor SUSEPEdhed Risk InstBrazilian Sch Insurance ENS;;;2022-09-20;WOS:000853424300001;;

It briefly discusses three-high-frequency volatility models, large-scale multivariate ARCH models, and derivatives pricing models. Two further frontiers are examined in more detail-application of ARCH models to the broad class of non-negative processes, and use of Least Squares Monte Carlo to examine non-linear properties of any model that can be simulated. Using this methodology, the paper analyses more general types of ARCH models, stochastic volatility models, long-memory models and breaking volatility models. The volatility of volatility is defined, estimated and compared with option-implied volatilities.

The method combines two techniques recently proposed in the literature in two separate steps. In the first step, the closed form approach of Ait-Sahalia (2008) is used to obtain a highly accurate approximation to the joint transition probability density of the latent and the observed states. In the second step, the efficient importance sampling technique of Richard and Zhang (2007) is used to integrate out the latent states, thereby yielding the likelihood function. Using both simulated and real data, we show that the proposed ML method works better than alternative methods. The new method does not require the underlying diffusion to have an affine structure and does not involve infill simulations. Therefore, the method has a wide range of applicability and its computational cost is moderate. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

We reject linearity for the US and UK swap spreads in favour of a regime-switching smooth transition vector autoregressive (STVAR) model, where the switching between regimes is controlled by the slope of the US term structure of interest rates. We compare the ability of the STVAR model to predict swap spreads with that of a non-linear nearest-neighbours model as well as that of linear AR and VAR models. We find some evidence that the non-linear models predict better than the linear ones. At short horizons, the nearest-neighbours (NN) model predicts better than the STVAR model US swap spreads in periods of increasing risk conditions and UK swap spreads in periods of decreasing risk conditions. At long horizons, the STVAR model increases its forecasting ability over the linear models, whereas the NN model does not outperform the rest of the models.

We use estimation technology that facilitates nonnested model comparisons and use a long data set which provides rich information about the conditional and unconditional distribution of returns. We consider two broad families of models: (I) the multifactor loglinear family, and (2) the affine-jump family. Both classes of models have attracted much attention in the derivatives and econometrics literatures. There are various tradeoffs in considering such diverse specifications. If pure diffusion SV models are chosen over jump diffusions, it has important implications for hedging strategies. If logarithmic models are chosen over affine ones, it may seriously complicate option pricing. Comparing many different specifications of pure diffusion multifactor models and jump diffusion models, we find that (I) log linear models have to be extended to two factors with feedback in the mean reverting factor, (2) affine models have to have a jump in returns, stochastic volatility or probably both. Models (I) and (2) are observationally equivalent on the data set in hand. In either (I) or (2) the key is that the volatility can move violently. As we obtain models with comparable empirical fit, one must make a choice based on arguments other than statistical goodness-of-fit criteria. The considerations include facility to price options, to hedge and parsimony. The affine specification with jumps in volatility might therefore be preferred because of the closed-form derivatives prices. (C) 2003 Elsevier B.V.

Zhang and Cheng [M.-H. Zhang, Q.-S. Cheng, An Approach to VaR for capital markets with Gaussian mixture, Applied Mathematics and Computation 168 (2005) 1079-1085] proposed an approach to VaR for daily returns based on Gaussian mixtures, which have become rather popular in empirical economics and finance since the seminal paper of Hamilton [J.D. Hamilton, A new approach to the economic analysis of nonstationary time series and the business cycle, Econometrica 57 (2) (1989) 357-384]. However, they do not conduct tests to assess the accuracy of the mixture-implied VaR measures. Recently, Guidolin and Timmermann [M. Guidolin, A. Timmermann, Term structure of risk under alternative econometric specifications, Journal of Econometrics, 131 (2006) 285-308] showed that Markov mixture models do well in measuring VaR at a monthly frequency, but the results may not hold for daily returns due to their more pronounced non-Gaussian features. This paper provides an extensive application of various Markov mixture models to VaR for daily returns of major European stock markets, including out-of-sample backtesting. To accommodate the properties of daily returns, we consider both Gaussian and Student's t mixtures, and we compare the performance of both uni- and multivariate models under different parameter updating schemes. We find that a univariate mixture of two Student's t distributions performs best overall. However, by the example of the recent turmoil in financial markets, we also highlight a weak point of the approach. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc.

However, despite its popularity, its approximation error has not yet been examined rigorously. Therefore, this study investigates the reliability of the KF approximation for maximum likelihood (ML) and Bayesian estimations. To measure the approximation error, we compare the outcomes of the KF method with those of the auxiliary particle filter (APF). The APF is a numerical method that requires a longer computing time, but its numerical error can be sufficiently minimized by increasing simulation size. According to our extensive simulation and empirical studies, the likelihood values obtained from the KF approximation are practically identical to those of the APF. Furthermore, we show that the KF method is reliable, particularly when regimes are persistent and sample size is small. From the Bayesian perspective, we show that the KF method improves the efficiency of posterior simulation. This study contributes to the literature by providing evidence to justify the use of the KF method in both ML and Bayesian estimations.;;;;;;;;;5;0;0;0;0;0;7;;;0747-4938;1532-4168;;;;;;;;;;Korea Univ, Dept Econ, Seoul, South Korea;;;;2019-07-24;WOS:000474365700001;;

Although there is a vast literature on the quality of life in terms of health, there is no uniform point of view, since the well-being of a person implies other elements that consider not only health but also the economic and educational environment in which the individual evolves and often these factors are connected.

In most cases, alcohol consumption intensifies in time, significantly decresing the quality of life for the mother and especially for the conception product. The study focuses on showing the The study focuses on highlighting the psychosocial and pharmacological aspects relevant to the diagnosis and management of neonatal cerebral status. The study participants, whose responses were the base for the quantitative analyzes, were individually interviewed using a standardized interview protocol. The interviews were conducted between October 2015 and September 2017. The interview protocol included three sections, in this chapter focusing our attention on the following sections: a) socio-demographic characteristics: age of gestation, sex of the newborn; b) clinical data: Presentation, Weight at Birth, Apgar Score, Cerebral Saturation (rSO(2)), Peripheral saturation (SpO(2)), The extraction fraction (FTOE), Parameters harvested from the umbilical cord at birth (pH, Base excess (BE), pCO(2), pO(2), MetHb, COHb), c) risk profile: mother's alcohol consumption, including during pregnancy and drug use. The study group consisted of 90 infants born full term in Elena Doamna Maternity Hospital in Iasi, between 2015-2017, included in the programme of follow-up of the newborn with risk with the purpose of performing an non-invasive assessment of the fetal and neonatal cerebral status, in order to prevent and establish treatment methods for perinatal asphyxia. Based on the information obtained through the preliminary documentation, 30 newborns with alcohol and / or drug-consuming mothers and 60 neonates with risk-free mothers were selected - the control batch, who accepted to participate in the study. The cases studied showed the homogeneity of the groups depending on the mother's age and gestational age, as well as the sex of the newborn and the weight at birth (p>0.05). In neonates from mothers at risk, the under-reference level of 1-minute brain saturation, combined with a lower gestational age and the 62.5% probability of performing a caesarean section at low levels of cerebral saturation was noted in 66.7% of newborns. The cut off value of SpO(2), was established at 70 mL/100g/1 min, with a sensitivity of 50.9% and a specificity of 51.3%, after reading the coordinates of ROC curve, but the prediction was not significant from the statistical point of view (p=0.670). The mean level of base excess was al excesului de baze was slightly lower in newborns with the extraction fraction below the cut off value (-4.64 vs -4.18; p=0.560). According to the cases studied, 1 min after birth, 23.3% of the newborns showed an increased level of pCO(2) associated with a reduced level of peripheral saturation (r = -0.231; p=0.05). The correlation between the pO(2) level and the cerebral saturation, recorded 1 min after birth, was direct, but reduced as intensity (r= +0.295; p=0.049).About 27% of the newborns associated increased values of pO(2) with reduced values of the extraction fraction (r=-0.272; p=0.047). The newborns with an extraction fraction over the cut off value had a level of COHb below 1% (p=0.756) more frequently.

We consider the problem of estimating the (drift) parameters indexing the drift term of a threshold diffusion process with continuous-time observations. Maximum likelihood estimation of the drift parameters requires prior knowledge of the functional form of the diffusion term, which is, however, often unavailable. We propose a quasi-likelihood approach for estimating the drift parameters of a two-regime threshold diffusion process that does not require prior knowledge about the functional form of the diffusion term. We show that, under mild regularity conditions, the quasi-likelihood estimators of the drift parameters are consistent. Moreover, the estimator of the threshold parameter is super consistent and weakly converges to some non-Gaussian continuous distribution. Also, the estimators of the autoregressive parameters in the drift term are jointly asymptotically normal with distribution the same as that when the threshold parameter is known. The empirical properties of the quasi-likelihood estimator are studied by simulation. We apply the threshold model to estimate the term structure of a long time series of US interest rates. The proposed approach and asymptotic results can be readily lifted to the case of a multi-regime threshold diffusion process. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Given that trend-following rules are also very successful and have been widely used in futures markets, we analyze whether a similar effect can be observed for commodity futures contracts. Using a trend regression approach based on time-varying success ratios, we detect significantly higher predictive accuracy for cross-sectional than for time-series strategies. In addition, with the exception of a few commodities, we find no significant trending behavior in trading rule reliability.

The parameters of BMSM-Skewed t model can be estimated by Maximum Likelihood (ML) methods, and volatility forecasting can be accomplished via Bayesian updating. In order to evaluate the performance of BMSM-Skewed t model, BMSM model with Normal innovations (BMSM-N), BMSM model with Student-t innovations (BMSM-t) and GARCH(1,1) models (GARCH-N, GARCH-t and GARCH-Skewed t) are chosen for comparison. Through empirical studies on Shanghai Stock Exchange Composite Index (SSEC), we find that for sample estimation, BMSM models outperform the GARCH(1,1) models through BIC and AIC rules, and BMSM-Skewed t performs the best among all the models due to its fat tails, skewness and multifractality.

A unique feature of the test is its ability to distribute natural weights automatically between the mean and the variance components of the goodness-of-fit measure. To reduce the dependence of the test on a single pair of smoothing bandwidths, we construct an adaptive test by maximizing a standardized version of the empirical likelihood test statistic over a set of smoothing bandwidths. The test procedure is based on a bootstrap calibration to the distribution of the empirical likelihood test statistic.

Our main objective is to distinguish between contango and backwardation regimes when analysing the relationship between the futures spread and changes in the first nearby futures price.

However, many researchers have shown that this assumption is violated in practice. Such violations include the statistical properties of heavy tails, volatility clustering, leptokurtosis and long memory. This paper considers the pricing of contingent claims when the underlying is assumed to display long memory, an issue that has heretofore not received much attention.Aim: We address several theoretical and practical issues in option pricing and implied volatility calibration in a fractional Black-Scholes market. We introduce a novel eight-parameter fractional Black-Scholes-inspired (FBSI) model for the implied volatility surface, and consider in depth the issue of calibration. One of the main benefits of such a model is that it allows one to decompose implied volatility into an independent long-memory component-captured by an implied Hurst exponent-and a conditional implied volatility component. Such a decomposition has useful applications in the areas of derivatives trading, risk management, delta hedging and dynamic asset allocation.Setting: The proposed FBSI volatility model is calibrated to South African equity index options data as well as South African Rand/American Dollar currency options data. However, given the focus on the theoretical development of the model, the results in this paper are applicable across all financial markets.Methods: The FBSI model essentially combines a deterministic function form of the 1-year implied volatility skew with a separate deterministic function for the implied Hurst exponent, thus allowing one to model both observed implied volatility surfaces as well as decompose them into independent volatility and long-memory components respectively. Calibration of the model makes use of a quasi-explicit weighted least-squares optimisation routine.Results: It is shown that a fractional Black-Scholes model always admits a non-constant implied volatility term structure when the Hurst exponent is not 0.5, and that 1-year implied volatility is independent of the Hurst exponent and equivalent to fractional volatility. Furthermore, we show that the FBSI model fits the equity index implied volatility data very well but that a more flexible Hurst exponent parameterisation is required to fit accurately the currency implied volatility data.Conclusion: The FBSI model is an arbitrage-free deterministic volatility model that can accurately model equity index implied volatility. It also provides one with an estimate of the implied Hurst exponent, which could be very useful in derivatives trading and delta hedging.;;;;;;;;;4;0;0;1;0;0;6;;;2222-3436;;;;;;;;;;;Univ Pretoria, Dept Math & Appl Math, Pretoria, South Africa;;;;2017-04-26;WOS:000398580900010;;

An approximation based on efficient importance sampling (EIS) is detailed. Monte Carlo experiments, based on widely used diffusion processes, evaluate its performance against an alternative importance sampling (IS) strategy, showing that EIS is at least equivalent, if not superior, while allowing a greater flexibility needed when examining more complicated models.

In this paper, the pseudo Maximum Likelihood Estimation and consistent extended Kalman filter (PMLE-CEKF) are implemented synchronously to estimate the Heston model. For parameter estimations, PMLE for the state equation and the measurement equation of the Heston model are conducted independently. For volatility estimations, the consistent extended Kalman filter (CEKF) algorithm is introduced to ensure the volatility to be well evaluated. Additionally, the estimation results of the Heston model are compared between PMLE-CEKF and PMLE-EKF algorithm. The numerical simulations illustrate that PMLE-CEKF algorithm works more efficiently than PMLE-EKF algorithm. Application of the PMLE-CEKF to S&P 500 shows the utility of the proposed algorithm.

We show that the conventional results in Johansen (1996) for the maximum likelihood estimators and associated likelihood ratio tests derived under homoskedasticity do not in general hold under heteroskedasticity. As a result, standard confidence intervals and hypothesis tests on these coefficients are potentially unreliable. Solutions based on Wald tests (using a sandwich estimator of the variance matrix) and on the use of the wild bootstrap are discussed. These do not require the practitioner to specify a parametric model for volatility. We establish the conditions under which these methods are asymptotically valid. A Monte Carlo simulation study demonstrates that significant improvements in finite sample size can be obtained by the bootstrap over the corresponding asymptotic tests in both heteroskedastic and homoskedastic environments. An application to the term structure of interest rates in the US illustrates the difference between standard and bootstrap inferences regarding hypotheses on the co-integrating vectors and adjustment coefficients.

The combination of structural change and serial correlation renders model estimation challenging, affecting the consistency of coefficient estimates. Although there is vast literature concerning structural change tests for linear time series models, the literature for such tests in the context of binary choice models is somewhat sparse. More importantly, the empirical literature has applied the standard tests of structural change on the discrete choice model, despite the fact that most of these tests were developed specifically for the linear regression model. Subsequently, the theoretical properties of these tests in the context of non-linear models are unknown. This includes the class of discrete choice models, such as probit and logit. The issue becomes even more complicated in the presence of serial correlation, since typical tests for structural change often require the assumption of independence in the error terms. Even when the tests allow for a weakly dependent structure in the data, their finite sample performance remains unknown. This paper conducts simulation analysis on the size of 'supremum' Wald, LR and LM tests for structural change in the context of the probit model with varying levels of serial correlation. It is found that the shortcomings of the tests in linear models are magnified in probit models. In particular, the tests exhibit greater size distortion for the probit model than the linear model with the same level of serial correlation. Bootstrapping is also considered as an alternative approach to obtaining critical values, and though it reduces the size distortion in finite samples, it is unable to accommodate the distortion associated with a high level of serial correlation.
