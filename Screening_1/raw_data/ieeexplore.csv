Constant-coefficient models cannot capture these changes as they give rise to time-homogeneous distributions. Maximum likelihood fitting of a one-factor time-dependent Extended-CIR model of the term structure, whose closed-form solution was previously obtained by the author, shows that it can capture these changes, as well as achieve significantly higher likelihood value. It is shown that exploitation of the closed-form solutions substantially improves the accuracy and efficiency of Monte Carlo simulations over high-order discretization algorithms. It is also shown that the feasibility of exact one-to-one calibration of the model to any continuous yield curve allows valuation of bond options significantly more accurately and efficiently.","1471-6798","","10.1093/imaman/11.3.161","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8132325","Interest rates;term structure;square-root models;Maximum Likelihood;model estimation;yield curve fitting;option pricing","","","","","","","18 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

"Two Derivative Algorithms of Gradient Boosting Decision Tree for Silicon Content in Blast Furnace System Prediction","S. Luo; T.

The blast furnace system is a highly complex industrial reactor in the conventional process. The system is subject to several problems (e.g., system automation, the thermal state of the blast furnace, and the life prediction of blast furnace) that should be addressed by professionals. To determine the prediction state of the heat in the blast furnace, the silicon content in the blast furnace molten iron commonly acts as a key indicator. Based on the assumption that the blast furnace system exhibits a stable state, the accuracy of hot metal silicon is analyzed by using a range of machine learning algorithms. In the present study, two derivative algorithms of gradient boosting decision tree are adopted to develop a strong boosting predictor based on the extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost) algorithm and the light gradient boosting machine (LightGBM) algorithm for prediction. Compared with the conventional algorithms (e.g., lasso, random forest, support vector machine and gradient boosting decision tree), the prediction by using the two boosting algorithms is capable of more effectively guiding and determining the state of the blast furnace. As revealed from experimentally simulated results, the mentioned two boosting algorithms exhibit better comprehensive prediction performance than the conventional algorithms on the datasets of two practical blast furnace systems, demonstrating that the R-square of the two blast furnaces in the training set is over 0.7. The mentioned two algorithms are of certain guiding significance for exploring blast furnace problems.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2020.3034566","Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61973145); Foundation of the Education Department of Jiangxi Province(grant numbers:GJJ180247); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9243945","XGBoost;LightGBM;gradient boosting decision tree;silicon content;blast furnace system","Prediction algorithms;Silicon;Iron;Blast furnaces;Predictive models;Boosting;Decision trees","","19","","47","CCBY","29 Oct 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, as a significant factor, trust had been neglected in previous team performance models. In this paper, we investigate whether trust can be used as a predictor of cross-functional team performance by proposing a prediction model. The inputs of the model are both team structural and contextual (SC) factors, and project process (PP) factors, which are two major sources that form team trust. The output of the model is different levels of team performance, which consists of internal performance and external performance. The support vector machine techniques are used to establish the model. Results show that prediction accuracy is high (84.95%) when using both SC and PP factors as inputs, while PP factors have better prediction accuracy than SC factors on team performance and internal performance. It is suggested that team trust can be used as a good predictor of cross-functional team performance. In practice, this paper presents a better understanding of the relationship between trust and performance in cross-functional teams, and thus, enhances practitioners' managerial skills. It also gives reference for managers to dynamically control and predict team performance during project period.","1558-0040","","10.1109/TEM.2014.2380177","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:71272146); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7004820","Cross-functional team (CFTs);support vector machine (SVM);team performance (TP);trust;Cross-functional team (CFTs);support vector machine (SVM);team performance (TP);trust","Support vector machines;IP networks;Accuracy;Organizations;Predictive models;Kernel;Biological system modeling","","7","","42","IEEE","8 Jan 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, a major weakness of neural modeling is the lack of established procedures for performing tests for misspecified models, and tests of statistical significance for the various parameters that have been estimated. This is a serious disadvantage in applications where there is a strong culture for testing not only the predictive power of a model or the sensitivity of the dependent variable to changes in the inputs but also the statistical significance of the finding at a specified level of confidence. Rarely is this more important than in the case of financial engineering, where the data generating processes are dominantly stochastic and only partially deterministic. Partly a tutorial, partly a review, this paper describes a collection of typical applications in options pricing, cointegration, the term structure of interest rates and models of investor behavior which highlight these weaknesses and propose and evaluate a number of solutions. We describe a number of alternative ways to deal with the problem of variable selection, show how to use model misspecification tests, we deploy a novel way based on cointegration to deal with the problem of nonstationarity, and generally describe approaches to predictive neural modeling which are more in tune with the requirements for modeling financial data series.","1941-0093","","10.1109/72.641449","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=641449","","Neural networks;Testing;Predictive models;Performance evaluation;Data engineering;Power engineering and energy;Stochastic processes;Pricing;Economic indicators;Input variables","","112","3","79","IEEE","6 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The findings highlight that innovation activity significantly enhances financial performance, underscoring blockchain’s role as a general-purpose technology with transformative sustainability potential. Public attention, measured through search interest, independently drives investor sentiment and market outcomes, while the interaction between innovation and public attention does not exhibit significant synergistic effects, suggesting distinct channels of influence. This study contributes to the growing stream of literature in sustainable finance, innovation management, and behavioral finance by introducing a real-time measure of blockchain innovation for sustainability into an asset pricing model, by showing that patent activity and public attention operate as separate predictors of financial returns, and by advancing methodological practice through the use of a state-space approach to capture latent innovation dynamics.

The problem requires predicting whether a company will deliver an earnings surprise a specific number of days prior to announcement. This problem has been well studied in the literature using linear models. A basic question is whether machine learning-based nonlinear models such as tree induction algorithms, neural networks, naive Bayesian learning, and genetic algorithms perform better in terms of predictive accuracy and in uncovering interesting relationships among problem variables. Equally importantly, if these alternative approaches perform better, why? And how do they stack up relative to each other? The answers to these questions are significant for predictive modeling in the financial arena, and in general for problem domains characterized by significant nonlinearities. In this paper, we compare the four above-mentioned nonlinear methods along a number of criteria. The genetic algorithm turns out to have some advantages in finding multiple ""small disjunct"" patterns that can be accurate and collectively capable of making predictions more often than its competitors. We use some of the nonlinearities we discovered about the problem domain to explain these results.","1941-0093","","10.1109/72.935099","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=935099","","Predictive models;Genetic algorithms;IEEE news;Machine learning;Accuracy;Investments;Finance;Learning systems;Machine learning algorithms;Neural networks","","31","","73","IEEE","7 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

"A Neural Network Architecture for Maximizing Alpha in a Market Timing Investment Strategy","J. H. Ospina-Holguín; A. M.

In this setting, alpha stands out as one of the most prevalent and refined measures of risk-adjusted return ever postulated, allowing for the estimation of the excess return that cannot be explained by the risk factors impacting an asset. This article introduces a neural network architecture designed to formulate an investment strategy with the explicit goal of maximizing alpha. The strategy, centered around market timing, determines on a daily basis, based on past returns of the risky asset, whether to fully invest in the risky asset or opt for the risk-free alternative. The neural network architecture comprises two components: a policy network for strategy implementation and an evaluation network for long-term alpha computation during parameter optimization. Employing value-weighted US size decile portfolios as risky assets, the study achieves significant out-of-sample alphas ranging from 3.6% to 8.2% per year under the  $q^{5}$  asset pricing model (with a transaction cost assumption of one basis point). By construction, these alphas are not generated by risky asset growth. Robustness tests yield similar results with equal-weighted decile portfolios or under the Fama and French six-factor asset pricing model. Variations in transaction cost, number of past returns used as inputs, policy network design, or training sample size produce similar outcomes. This study underscores the effectiveness of reinforcement learning-inspired techniques in uncovering alpha in financial markets.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2024.3446708","Universidad del Valle under Grant ‘‘Convocatoria Interna 131-2021 para presentación de Proyectos de Investigación y Creación Artística en las Ciencias, las Artes, las Humanidades, las Tecnologías y la Innovación.’’; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10640102","Alpha;asset pricing;reinforcement learning;stock returns;investment decisions;random walk hypothesis;market timing;machine learning;artificial intelligence","Pricing;Portfolios;Investment;Costs;Profitability;Neural networks;Reinforcement learning;Stock markets;Market research;Machine learning;Artificial intelligence","","2","","67","CCBYNCND","20 Aug 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

On the other hand, deep learning models have been hardly interpretable. This paper presents DeepClue, a system built to bridge text-based deep learning models and end users through visually interpreting the key factors learned in the stock price prediction model. We make three contributions in DeepClue. First, by designing the deep neural network architecture for interpretation and applying an algorithm to extract relevant predictive factors, we provide a useful case on what can be interpreted out of the prediction model for end users. Second, by exploring hierarchies over the extracted factors and displaying these factors in an interactive, hierarchical visualization interface, we shed light on how to effectively communicate the interpreted model to end users. Specially, the interpretation separates the predictables from the unpredictables for stock prediction through the use of intercept model parameters and a risk visualization design. Third, we evaluate the integrated visualization system through two case studies in predicting the stock price with financial news and company-related tweets from social media. Quantitative experiments comparing the proposed neural network architecture with state-of-the-art models and the human baseline are conducted and reported. Feedbacks from an informal user study with domain experts are summarized and discussed in details.

These models first use DNNs to predict each stock's future return. Then, predictive errors of DNNs are applied to measure the risk of each stock. Next, the portfolio optimization models are built by integrating the predictive returns and semi-absolute deviation of predictive errors. These models are compared with three equal weighted portfolios, where their stocks are selected by DMLP, LSTM neural network and CNN respectively. Also, two prediction-based portfolio models built with support vector regression are used as benchmarks. This paper applies component stocks of China securities 100 index in Chinese stock market as experimental data. Experimental results present that the prediction-based portfolio model based on DMLP performs the best among these models under different desired portfolio returns, and high desired portfolio return can further improve the performance of this model.

Although some researchers have experimentally demonstrated its ability to make a profit, it is still insufficient to use in real situations because existing studies have failed to answer how risky investment decisions are. Furthermore, even though the objective of PM is to maximize returns within a risk tolerance, they overlook the predictive uncertainty of DNNs in the process of risk management. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel framework called risk-sensitive multiagent network (RSMAN), which includes risk-sensitive agents (RSAs) and a risk adaptive portfolio generator (RAPG). Standard DNNs do not understand the risks of their decision, whereas RSA can take risk-sensitive decisions by estimating market uncertainty and parameter uncertainty. Acting as a trader, this agent is trained via reinforcement learning from dynamic trading simulations to estimate the distribution of reward and via unsupervised learning to assess parameter uncertainty without labeled data. We also present an RAPG that can generate a portfolio fitting the user’s risk appetite without retraining by exploiting the estimated information from the RSAs.

After a brief survey of nonlinear methods, nonlinear statistical techniques are applied to performance attribution of a portfolio constructed from a fixed universe of stocks using factors derived from some commonly used cross sectional linear multifactor models. By rebalancing this portfolio monthly, the cumulative returns for procedures based on standard linear multifactor model and three nonlinear techniques-model selection, additive models, and neural networks-are calculated and compared. It is found that the first two nonlinear techniques, especially in combination, outperform the standard linear model. The results in the neural-network case are inconclusive because of the great variety of possible models. Although these methods are more complicated and may require some tuning, toolboxes are developed and suggestions on calibration are proposed.

This paper presents a pioneering approach that integrates Reinforcement Learning (RL), specifically the Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) algorithm, into the strategy selection process for hedge fund management. Our model considers a diverse array of strategies, including Mean Reversion and Momentum, and employs advanced mathematical frameworks to evaluate and select the strategies. By leveraging RL, our algorithm learns to adaptively adjusts strategy allocations to maximize cumulative returns while adhering to the risk constraints.

Although SEC suggests a specific document format to standardize and simplify the analysis, in recent years, several companies have introduced their own format and organization of the contents, making human-based and automatic knowledge extraction inherently more difficult. In this research work, we investigate different Neural language models based on Transformer networks (Bidirectional recurrence-based, Autoregressive-based, and Autoencoders-based approaches) to automatically reconstruct an SEC-like format of the documents as a multi-class classification task with 18 classes at the sentence level. In particular, we propose a Bidirectional fine-tuning procedure to specialize pre-trained language models on this task. We propose and make the resulting novel transformer model, named SEC-former, publicly available to deal with this task. We evaluate SEC-former in three different scenarios: 1) in terms of topic detection performances; 2) in terms of document similarity (TF-IDF Bag-of-words and Doc2Vec) achieved with respect to original and trustable financial reports since this operation is leveraged for portfolio optimization tasks; and 3) testing the model in a real use-case scenario related to a public company that does not respect the SEC format but provides a human-supervised reference to reconstruct it.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2024.3370444","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10445214","SEC filings;deep learning;transformer;document reconstruction;topic detection;stock market","Task analysis;Transformers;Encoding;Companies;Bidirectional control;Predictive models;Data models;Deep learning;Stock markets;Document handling;Financial management;Neural networks;Natural language processing","","2","","30","CCBYNCND","26 Feb 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The proposed method is based on mapping non-normal marginal distributions into normal distributions via a probability conserving transformation and then using a quadratic, i.e. Delta–Gamma, approximation for the portfolio value. The method is very general and can deal with a wide range of marginal distributions of risk factors, including non-parametric distributions. Its computational load is comparable with the Delta–Gamma–Normal method based on Fourier inversion. However, unlike the Delta–Gamma–Normal method, the proposed heuristic preserves the tail behaviour of the individual risk factors, which may be seen as a significant advantage. We demonstrate the utility of the new method with comprehensive numerical experiments on simulated as well as real financial data.","1471-6798","","10.1093/imaman/dpu015","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8146531","value-at-risk;conditional value-at-risk;fat-tailed distributions","","","","","","","18 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

Powerful deep learning methods for alpha factor mining lack interpretability, making them unacceptable in the risk-sensitive real markets. Formulaic alpha factors are preferred for their interpretability, while the search space is complex and powerful explorative methods are urged. Recently, a promising framework is proposed for generating formulaic alpha factors using deep reinforcement learning, and quickly gained research focuses from both academia and industries. This paper first argues that the originally employed policy training method, i.e., Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO), faces several important issues in the context of alpha factors mining. Herein, a novel reinforcement learning algorithm based on the well-known REINFORCE algorithm is proposed. REINFORCE employs Monte Carlo sampling to estimate the policy gradient—yielding unbiased but high variance estimates. The minimal environmental variability inherent in the underlying state transition function, which adheres to the Dirac distribution, can help alleviate this high variance issue, making REINFORCE algorithm more appropriate than PPO. A new dedicated baseline is designed to theoretically reduce the commonly suffered high variance of REINFORCE. Moreover, the information ratio is introduced as a reward shaping mechanism to encourage the generation of steady alpha factors that can better adapt to changes in market volatility. Evaluations on real assets data indicate the proposed algorithm boosts correlation with returns by 3.83%, and a stronger ability to obtain excess returns compared to the latest alpha factors mining methods, which meets the theoretical results well.","1941-0476","","10.1109/TSP.2025.3576781","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:62272210,62250710682,62331014); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=11024173","Reinforcement learning;computational finance;quantitative finance;Markov decision processes","Data mining;Signal processing algorithms;Heuristic algorithms;Training;Prediction algorithms;Monte Carlo methods;Finance;Trajectory;Portfolios;Optimization","","","","66","IEEE","4 Jun 2025","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

How to update the velocities and positions of a swarm of particles is key to its optimization performance. In this paper, we propose to use the moving average of the local best positions visited so far as a key information to update the velocities and positions. Further, a central learning strategy is proposed in which the center of the local best positions is computed and used to update the global best position. Combining these two strategies with the updating formulas which are inspired by the free electron model in metal conductors placed in an external electric field, we name the proposed PSO algorithm as PSO with moving average and central learning strategies (dubbed as MAPSO). We test the performance of MAPSO on the CEC 2017 test problems with 10 and 30 dimensions. Experimental results show that MAPSO significantly outperforms some well-known PSOs in general. We then apply MAPSO on a very challenging real-world problem, i.e. the yield curve estimation problem, in macroeconomics.

However, they often face the challenge of information cocoons due to repeated content delivery, particularly prevalent in stock recommendations that are susceptible to investor sentiment. In response to the information cocoons, we propose the Sentiment and Price Combined Model (SPCM), which leverages sentiment features and price factors to predict stock price movements. This novel framework combines collective sentiment analysis with state-of-the-art BERT transformer models and advanced machine learning techniques. Over a three-year period, we collected 40 million stock comments from the Guba platform, extracting investor sentiment conveyed in text information and investigating the impact of metrics such as homophily on stock recommendations. Experimental results indicate that both the volume of posts and the agreement index affect the effectiveness of investor sentiment, while homophily reduces the accuracy of participants’ stock price judgments. The recognition accuracy of the BERT-based sentiment analysis model reaches an impressive 84.12%, and the portfolio constructed by SPCM yields a cumulative return four times that of the industry benchmark. Furthermore, homogeneous quantitative metrics also enhance diversification in stock selection.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2024.3357114","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10411881","BERT;decision making;homophily;machine learning;stock recommendation","Recommender systems;Social networking (online);Sentiment analysis;Stock markets;Predictive models;Indexes;Machine learning;Bit error rate;Decision making;Market research","","10","","66","CCBYNCND","22 Jan 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

EMD is designed for multiscale and adaptive time-frequency decomposition in nonstationary time series. EMD-RCR generates multi-time-frequency resolution adaptive forecasting models of predictive covariance forecasts for a universe of selected asset returns. This provides a unique method to obtain predictive covariance regression structures for the short-, mid-, and long-time-scale portfolio dynamics. EMD isolates structures in a frequency-hierarchical fashion (with automated sorting of structures through EMD-MDLP available) which allows this multi-time-frequency covariance forecasting framework that uses the structures isolated using EMD (referred to as IMFs: Intrinsic Mode Functions) as the explanatory variables in the RCR framework. Having developed these techniques, a case study is used for exposition for active portfolio asset management. The case study is based on a dynamic long/short equity and risk premia parity (or risk parity) portfolio-of-portfolios investment strategy using the 11 sectors dividing the 505 stocks of the S&P 500. Each of the 11 sector indices is constructed using a market capitalisation ratio of the companies within the respective sector. The portfolio will be reweighted monthly based on the covariance structure forecast using covariance regression, in which covariance regression factors will be obtained at multiple time-frequency scales endogenously from the ETF asset price returns from each sector. At the end of each month, the covariance is forecast for the next month or investment horizon. This is done using low-, mid-, and high-frequency IMFs isolated using EMD from the 11 sector indices over the previous year. The IMFs isolated from the 11 sector indices over the previous year are fitted against the daily logarithmic returns in the RCR model to make multi-frequency covariance forecasts. We construct long/short equity and risk premia parity portfolios using each different covariance forecast and review the results. The performance of the portfolios will be measured using multiple performance measures (the most relevant being risk-related measures with risk premia parity in focus) and contrasted against multiple benchmark portfolios using several well-known portfolio optimisation techniques such as PCA and multivariate GARCH extensions. This paper promotes what we term “implicit factor” extraction, empirical market factors, and RCR in portfolio optimisation, horizon-specific active portfolio optimisation, long/short equity portfolios, and risk parity portfolios.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2024.3444479","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10637332","INDEX TERMS Risk parity;long/short equity;active fund management;portfolio optimisation;empirical mode decomposition (EMD);singular spectrum analysis (SSA);singular spectrum decomposition (SSD);regularised covariance regression (RCR);expectation maximisation","Portfolios;Time series analysis;Forecasting;Feature extraction;Predictive models;Optimization;Estimation","","","","98","CCBY","15 Aug 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Currently, day-ahead frequency regulation service is one major revenue source for BESS, and the revenue is exposed to a compound of stochastic market risk and technical risk. On the market risk side, due to a lack of long-term contracts, investors are exposed to “price risk” and “volume (revenue hours) risk” over the entire investment horizon of 5–10 years. On the technical side, performance issues such as equipment degradation and inherent defects can result in reduced or even negative revenue for BESS under the pay-for-performance remuneration structure. Quantifying these risks is important for investors and banks to assess a project’s investability and bankability. However, existing BESS techno-economic literature has mostly focused on developing optimal control strategies to maximize revenue or optimal battery sizing to reduce capital expenditure. To our knowledge, none of the literature to date has addressed the long-term risk perspective of BESS investment. This study aims to fill this gap by developing a long-term probabilistic revenue estimate that considers these risk factors using Monte Carlo simulations. A case study using Taiwan’s newly launched day-ahead market, which has similar grid dynamics and revenue risk factors as in most markets, is also presented in this paper. Simulation result shows that, for the conservative P90 (90% exceedance probability) scenario, expected return of a hypothetical 10MW (half-hour battery) BESS investment is 8.65% and its debt service coverage ratio is 1.189.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2024.3390439","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10504254","Battery energy storage system;BESS investment;day ahead market;frequency regulation ancillary service;probabilistic revenue estimate;P90;DSCR;investability;bankability","Investment;Frequency control;Batteries;Costs;Regulation;Probabilistic logic;Power grids;Battery energy storage system;Energy storage;Risk management","","1","","32","CCBYNCND","17 Apr 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In the luxury car segment, residual value (RV), the car’s actual value at the end of ownership, is particularly significant. A high RV translates into lower overall ownership costs, as the car retains more of its value over time, which can boost demand as well as leasing margin. For this reason, the analysis of RV offers key insights for strategic decision-making. The present study leverages a large-scale global dataset spanning a 10-year period, capturing both internal vehicle features and three available external market conditions (CPI, unemployment rate, and 10-year bond yield). Our approach employs machine learning techniques, particularly CatBoost, achieving a mean absolute percentage error of around 5%, deemed highly acceptable within the industry.

Pioneering statistical approaches investigate manually defined features to capture lexical, sentiment, and event information, which suffer from feature sparsity. As a remedy, recent work has considered learning dense vector representations for documents. Such representations are general, which can not model target-dependent scenarios, such as stance detection towards a specific claim. There has been work on target-specific word and sentence representations, but little was done on target-dependent document representation. Moreover, documents contain more potentially helpful information, but also noise compared to events and sentences. To address the above issues, we focus on models that are: 1. task-driven, which optimize the neural network representations for the end task; 2. target-specific, learning news representations by considering the influence of specific targets. In particular, we propose a novel document-level target-dependent learning framework TEND. The framework employs the information of the target and the news abstract as clues, obtaining relatively informative sentences from the entire document for our objectives. The framework assembles a document representation by integrating the news abstract representation and a weighted sum of sentence representations in the document. To the best of our knowledge, we are among the first to investigate target-dependent document representation. Existing text representation models can be easily integrated into our TEND framework, and it is general enough to be applied to different target-dependent document representation tasks. We empirically evaluate our framework on two target-dependent document-level tasks, including a cumulative abnormal return prediction task and a news stance detection task. Results show that our models give the best performances compared to state-of-the-art document embedding methods, yielding robust and consistent performances across datasets.","2329-9304","","10.1109/TASLP.2019.2947364","National Basic Research Program of China (973 Program)(grant numbers:SQ2018AAA010010); National Basic Research Program of China (973 Program)(grant numbers:2018YFB1005103); National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61702137); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8868172","Stock Market Prediction;Target-dependent Representation;Document Representation;Stance Detection","Task analysis;Text mining;Twitter;Speech processing;Logic gates;Internet;Neural networks","","4","","52","IEEE","14 Oct 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Trend representation of asset price is one of the main information to be exploited in PS. However, most state-of-the-art trend representation-based systems exploit only one kind of trend information and lack effective mechanisms to construct a composite trend representation. The proposed system exploits a set of RBFs with multiple trend representations, which improves the effectiveness and robustness in price prediction. Moreover, the input of the RBFs automatically switches to the best trend representation according to the recent investing performance of different price predictions. We also propose a novel objective to combine these RBFs and select the portfolio. Extensive experiments on six benchmark data sets (including a new challenging data set that we propose) from different real-world stock markets indicate that the proposed RBFs effectively combine different trend representations and AICTR achieves state-of-the-art investing performance and risk control. Besides, AICTR withstands the reasonable transaction costs and runs fast; hence, it is applicable to real-world financial environments.","2162-2388","","10.1109/TNNLS.2018.2827952","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61703182,11631015,U1611265,61572536,61403164); Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities(grant numbers:21617347,16lgzd16); Jinan University(grant numbers:88016653); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8356708","Adaptive input;composite trend representation;portfolio selection (PS);radial basis functions (RBF)","Market research;Portfolios;Microsoft Windows;Adaptive systems;Mathematics;Radial basis function networks;Learning systems","","32","","47","IEEE","9 May 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Meanwhile, various risk measurements such as variance, entropy, and Value-at-Risk have been proposed in fuzzy environments to evaluate investment risks from different perspectives. Sharpe ratio, also known as the reward-to-variability ratio, which measures the risk premium per unit of the nonsystematic risk (asset deviation), has received great attention in modern portfolio theory. In this study, the Sharpe ratio in fuzzy environments is introduced, whereafter, a fuzzy Value-at-Risk ratio is proposed. Compared with Sharpe ratio, Value-at-Risk ratio is an index with dimensional knowledge that reflects the risk premium per unit of the systematic risk (the greatest loss under a given confidence level). On the basis of the two ratios, a multi-objective model is built to evaluate their joint impact on portfolio selection. Then, the proposed model is solved by a fuzzy simulation based multi-objective particle swarm optimization algorithm, where the global best of each iteration is determined by an improved dominance times based method. Finally, the algorithm superiority is justified via comparing with existing solvers on benchmark problems, and the model effectiveness is exemplified by using three case studies on portfolio selection.","1941-0034","","10.1109/TFUZZ.2018.2842752","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61603176); Natural Science Foundation of Jiangsu Province(grant numbers:BK20160632); Young Scholar Support Programme of Nanjing University of Finance and Economics(grant numbers:L_YXW15101); Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8370687","Fuzzy portfolio selection;multi-objective particle swarm optimization (MOPSO);Sharpe ratio (SR);Value-at-Risk (VaR) ratio","Portfolios;Reactive power;Security;Investment;Entropy;Sorting;Fuzzy set theory","","48","","41","IEEE","1 Jun 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Issuing green bonds, as a financing procedure targeted to green engineering projects and demonstrating the issuers’ environmentally friendly attitude, does and how does it affect the issuers’ stock prices, liquidity, and risk? We address this issue by paying attention to the Chinese green bond issuance events. Utilizing the event study method, research shows that investors react positively to green bond issuance events. However, this reaction is only sensitive to green bond listing events, but not to announcements. Investor responses can be reflected in the abnormal changes in stock prices and liquidity. Both the stock systematic risk and idiosyncratic risk show little change after firms issue green bonds, which illustrates that green bond issuance cannot shape the inherent investors’ value judgments on issuer companies, thereby only producing temporary impacts. This study suggests that the green premium of corporate stocks induced by green bond issuance events may be sourced from investors’ optimistic predictions about green transformation, rather than investors’ subjective willingness to promote environmental sustainability.","1558-0040","","10.1109/TEM.2025.3538945","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:72133003,72495151); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10874181","Corporate sustainability;event study;green bonds;investors","Green products;Sustainable development;Stock markets;Companies;Instruments;Finance;Ethics;Stakeholders;Shape;Investment","","1","","70","IEEE","5 Feb 2025","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

As our first contribution, we formalize the preintegration of linear velocity measurements, obtained by a Doppler velocity log (DVL), in combination with angular velocity measurements, obtained by an inertial measurement unit (IMU), as binary factors encoding relative position. To evaluate state estimation improvements imparted by DVL/IMU fusion, we implement our proposed factor within a state-of-the-art, graph-based lidar-visual-inertial (LVI) SLAM system as our second contribution. Accuracy and robustness improvements are demonstrated in simulation by comparing maximum a posteriori pose estimates with and without DVL/IMU fusion against ground truth poses. As our third contribution, we propose a map generation framework for downstream inspection applications decoupled from SLAM. In our framework, volumetric data (captured by sonar, lidar, etc.) is transformed into a common world coordinate frame using extrinsic calibrations and SLAM pose estimates as input. Our framework operates over the complete set of raw volumetric data, whereas SLAM systems (both online and offline) typically operate over a subset of down-sampled volumetric data. To address the processing of additional volumetric data, we present innovations in refined pose correction and staged filtering for user-controlled denoising. We experimentally evaluate our map generation framework against the LVI SLAM system adopted for this study using real-world data and demonstrate improvements to map quality metrics important to inspection.","1558-1691","","10.1109/JOE.2023.3265742","Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada; University of California; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10149804","Doppler velocity log;inspection;mapping;sensor fusion;simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM);unmanned surface vehicles (USVs)","Simultaneous localization and mapping;Velocity measurement;Laser radar;Inspection;Sonar;Sea measurements;Robustness","","18","","57","IEEE","13 Jun 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The use of NDTs enables a comprehensive and dynamic digital representation of the physical network, capturing critical aspects, such as topology, traffic patterns, and performance metrics, which permits data-driven decision-making to lead to more efficient networking operations. The incorporation of cloud-native SDN controllers along with an NDT ensures that the system remains scalable, flexible, and responsive to dynamic network conditions. Intent-based networking, powered by GenAI, allows the network to interpret high-level objectives from operators and autonomously translate them into actionable configurations that are enforced by orchestrators and SDN controllers. This eliminates manual intervention, minimizes errors, accelerates the deployment of network services, and provides a means for easier network management. The presented framework significantly enhances automation, enabling predictive maintenance by identifying potential issues before they impact network performance. It optimizes network design by simulating various configurations and testing their feasibility in a risk-free environment.

In the big data era, university students have gained a more relaxed environment in which to receive and disseminate public opinion information, enabling them to spread their opinions and insights to the Internet more rapidly, thus exacerbating the riskiness of public opinion information dissemination. We constructed CUOPO, the first risk classification dataset of China university online public opinion, and screened out 10,255 representative public opinion texts from a large number of university online public opinion information, including 3,641 risk-free and 6,614 risky texts. These risky texts cover many fields, including 1,755 college livelihood risk texts, 767 campus safety risk texts, 1,395 school order risk texts, 906 university reputation risk texts, and 1,793 advertisement risk texts. The dataset contains various information about each network opinion, including authentic labels, text information, time information, and network information. Through an in-depth study of CUOPO, we found that universities have significant risk issues in the areas of livelihood, safety, teaching order, reputation, and advertisement diversion, which require great attention from university administrators. To validate the effectiveness of the CUOPO, we conduct extensive experiments on the dataset using a series of neural network methods to provide benchmark results for predicting online public opinion risk texts. We expect that CUOPO can provide strong data support for the study of the types of online public opinion risks in colleges and universities and thus play a positive role in promoting the progress of college and university public opinion research.
