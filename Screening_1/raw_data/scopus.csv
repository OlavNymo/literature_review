However, previous studies have faced challenges in extracting hidden factors related to gold price prediction from diverse economic indicators, and the comprehensive exploration of gold price data is yet to be fully achieved. To address this, the present study introduces a mid to long-term gold price prediction model named DPformer. This model utilizes a patching strategy to investigate the relationships between different economic indicators and Gold Prices. It also employs a decomposition approach to discover the mid to long-term trend characteristics and yearly seasonal patterns of Gold Prices. The core of the model integrates a Transformer module, which is solely based on an Encoder structure, and enhances it with multiple attention mechanisms and convolutions. This enhancement allows the improved Transformer model to more effectively capture the long-term dependencies of Gold Prices. The empirical results demonstrate that DPformer consistently outperforms a suite of advanced models widely adopted in terms of mid to long-term forecasting accuracy, including LSTM, GRU, Transformer, DLinear, and PatchTST. Notably, for the 30-step gold price prediction task, DPformer achieves a 21.78 % reduction in Mean Squared Error compared to PatchTST. Moreover, by quantitatively analyzing how various economic indicators influence gold price forecasts, this study provides substantial support for investors in making informed decisions at critical moments. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Economic indicators; Gold price; Patching; Time series; Transformer","Costs; Economic analysis; Financial markets; Forecasting; Gold; Inflation; Investments; Economic indicators; Gold prices; Government bonds; Inflation rates; Medium term; Patching; Price prediction; Times series; Transformer; US dollar; Time series","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-105015297138"

However, the model's effectiveness is highly dependent on the quality of its inputs and is often challenged by subjective or biased views. Recent advancements in deep learning have enabled the generation of more objective, data-driven views, significantly enhancing the model's accuracy and reliability. In this study, we propose a novel CGL-BL Model, which employs a hybrid deep learning approach—CEEMDAN-GLSTM-LSTM (CGL)—to generate investor views. The CGL model leverages the CEEMDAN algorithm for return-based time series decomposition, a Genetic Algorithm-optimized LSTM network to enhance prediction accuracy, and an additional LSTM network for nonlinear aggregation of prediction results. The proposed CGL-BL model was evaluated on both the SSE 50 Index in China and the DJIA in the United States. Empirical results show that the proposed CGL-BL model outperforms all benchmark portfolios in terms of excess return, Sharpe ratio, and maximum drawdown when applied with a short-term rebalancing strategy on the SSE 50 Index and a medium-to-long-term strategy on the DJIA, demonstrating strong potential for practical application in financial markets. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Black-Litterman; CEEMDAN; LSTM; Portfolio management; Stock market prediction","Benchmarking; Commerce; Decentralized finance; Deep learning; Electronic trading; Forecasting; Genetic algorithms; Investments; Black-litterman; CEEMDAN; Data driven; Hybrid model; LSTM; Market data; Model reliability; Portfolio managements; Portfolio optimization; Stock market prediction; Financial markets","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-105009900832"

We present a comprehensive Bayesian formulation that addresses both in-sample and out-of-sample forecasting within a broad class of generalized count time series regression models. The GLGARMA framework supports various count distributions, including Poisson, negative binomial, generalized Poisson, and double Poisson distributions, offering the flexibility to capture key empirical characteristics such as underdispersion, equidispersion, and overdispersion in the data. We connect the counting process to a time series regression framework through a link function, which is associated with a stochastic linear predictor incorporating the family of long-memory GARMA models. This linear predictor is central to the model's formulation, requiring careful specification of both the GLGARMA Bayesian likelihood and the resulting posterior distribution. To model the stochastic error terms driving the linear predictor, we explore two approaches: parameter-driven and observation-driven frameworks. For model estimation, we adopt a Bayesian approach under both frameworks, leveraging advanced sampling techniques, specifically the Riemann manifold Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods implemented via R-Stan. To demonstrate the practical utility of our models, we conduct an empirical study of open interest dynamics in US Treasury Bond Futures. Our Bayesian models are used to forecast speculative pressure, a crucial concept for understanding market behavior and agent actions. The analysis includes 136 distinct time series from the US Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), encompassing futures-only and futures-and-options data across four US government-issued fixed-income securities. Our findings indicate that the proposed Bayesian GLGARMA models outperform existing state-of-the-art models in forecasting open interest and speculative pressure. These improvements in forecast accuracy directly enhance portfolio performance, underscoring the practical value of our approach for bond futures portfolio construction. This work advances both the methodology for modeling long-memory count processes and its application in financial econometrics, particularly in improving the forecasting of speculative pressure and its impact on investment strategies. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Bayesian forecasting; Gegenbauer long memory; GLARMA; hedging pressure; liquidity; long-memory count processes; open interest; traded volume","Autoregressive moving average model; Bayesian networks; Commerce; Economic analysis; Electronic trading; Financial markets; Forecasting; Investments; Regression analysis; Stochastic models; Stochastic systems; Time series; Time series analysis; Bayesian forecasting; Count process; Gegenbaue long memory; Gegenbauer; GLARMA; Hedging pressures; Liquidity; Long memory; Long-memory count process; Open interest; Traded volume; Poisson distribution","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-105009700778"

As a key benchmark in global financial markets, the 10-year Treasury yield is influenced by multiple economic factors, including core inflation, the federal funds rate, GDP growth, and the U.S. Federal government's debt growth rate. Leveraging historical data from the Federal Reserve Economic Database (FRED), this study develops predictive models to assess the impact of these factors on yield fluctuations. Empirical results indicate that the random forest model outperforms the other approaches, achieving the lowest mean squared error (MSE) and mean absolute error (MAE), alongside an R2 of 0.6073. This suggests its superior ability to capture nonlinear relationships in yield movements. The decision tree model also demonstrates competitive accuracy but is more susceptible to overfitting. Conversely, linear regression provides useful interpretability but struggles to capture complex economic interactions, leading to lower predictive accuracy. Despite its potential for handling nonlinear dependencies, the MLP model underperforms compared to the random forest, yielding an R2 of 0.5058. The findings underscore the advantages of machine learning, particularly ensemble-based methods, in short-term Treasury yield forecasting. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","federal funds rate; GDP; inflation rate; random forest; U.S. federal government debt growth rate; U.S. treasury bond","Economic analysis; Electronic trading; Financial markets; Forecasting; Inflation; Learning systems; Linear regression; Machine learning; Mean square error; Random forests; Federal fund rate; Federal funds; GDP; Inflation rates; Treasury bonds; U.S. federal government; US federal government debt growth rate; US treasury bond; Yield forecasting; Decision trees","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-105015141371"

Estimating the model with Greek data, I find that an earlier inception of OMT plausibly could have prevented the observed default, but the resulting counterfactual Greek state would have been so fragile that, absent any further fiscal consolidation, eventual default was effectively inevitable. Moreover, the present Greek state remains sufficiently fragile that a quick return to a predominantly private financing scheme is not advisable. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Bounded rationality; Greek debt crisis; Nonlinear dynamics; Particle filter; Political default; Purification","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-105012113857"

To address the challenges of capturing complex stochastic dynamics, this study proposes a novel Bayesian-Optimized GRU-Enhanced Physics-Informed Neural Network (G-PINNs) architecture, integrated with the Hull–White (HW) short-rate model, to improve the prediction accuracy of yield forecasting, zero-coupon bond (ZCB) pricing, and option pricing. The proposed framework effectively models time dependent variations and stochastic behavior in interest rate dynamics by leveraging Gated Recurrent Units (GRU) for sequential pattern recognition and Physics Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) to enforce financial constraints through partial differential equations (PDEs) of the HW model. For empirical validation, US treasury yield data from April 2020 to March 2025 is utilized. To achieve the best optimal hyperparameters to enhance both predictive accuracy and training efficiency, Bayesian Optimization (BO) is employed for hyperparameter tuning. The proposed model outperforms Vanilla PINNs as evidenced by higher R2 values and reduced error metrics (MAE, MSE, RMSE, Max & Min error, MSLE, Huber loss, MedAE) in yield prediction, ZCB pricing, and option pricing, as indicated by the numerical results. Furthermore, the results are statistically validated through the paired t-test, which confirms that the G-PINNs model's performance improvement is significant and not a consequence of random variation.

Therefore the development of a proper forecasting framework suitable for both stable and volatile periods has assumed an increasing importance for market players and policymakers in both strategic planning and risk management. At present, the majority of the studies on electricity price forecasting focused on the analysis of spot markets, neglecting the importance of derivative price modeling to mitigate the risks induced by market downturns and turmoil. Our study nests within this research stream and analyzes the potential of a set of state-of-the-art Machine Learning (ML) models for the prediction of the term structure of electricity futures prices. The objective is to define an ML-based framework capable of ensuring high predictive performance of the term structure during both stable and extremely turbulent conditions. In this regard we examined the predictive capabilities of a variety of Dynamic Recurrent Neural Networks (DRNNs) including: Nonlinear Autoregressive Neural Networks (NAR-NNs), NAR with Exogenous Inputs (NARX-NNs), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM-NNs), Stacked Long Short-Term Memory (ST-LSTM-NNs), Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (BI-LSTM-NNs) and Encoder–Decoder Long Short-Term Memory Neural Networks (ED-LSTM-NNs). The models were applied to both low fluctuating and volatile sets of daily futures prices of the European Energy Exchange (EEX) for univariate as well as multivariate forecasting. Additionally, we compared this set of networks to baseline models commonly used in the EPF literature, including classical statistical and ML methods. Empirical results highlighted that DRNN models predictions are consistent with futures prices trends observed under different market regimes and outperform the competitors’ performance. Overall, main outcomes of the study may be summarized as follows: LSTM-based models seem to have the highest predictive power, with robust performance under various conditions. In detail the Multivariate BI-LSTM-NN performs better under quiet market conditions ensuring an accuracy level of 98.11 %, while the Univariate ED-LSTM-NN ensures superior predictive performance in presence of turmoil, achieving a 95.33 % accuracy. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Dynamic Recurrent Neural Networks; Electricity futures curve prediction; Futures prices term structure; LSTM-NN models; NAR-NN; NARX-NN","Risk perception; Strategic planning; Autoregressive neural networks; Curve prediction; Dynamic recurrent neural networks; Electricity future curve prediction; Electricity futures; Future price term structure; LSTM-NN model; NARX-NN; Nonlinear autoregressive neural network; Term structure; Risk management; accuracy assessment; artificial neural network; energy market; machine learning; market conditions; price dynamics; Europe","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-105006717802"

These intricate relationships are sometimes not adequately captured by traditional econometric models. In recent years, deep learning (DL) methodologies have gained prominence in the financial market, offering advanced predictive capabilities by modeling high-dimensional dependencies and nonlinear interactions inside yield curves. To enhance the predictive accuracy of short-term (13-week) and long-term (5-year) US Treasury yields, this study leverages advanced deep learning models, including convolutional neural networks (CNNs), long short-term memory (LSTM) networks, and gated recurrent units (GRUs). A comprehensive statistical evaluation is performed to assess model performance through key error metrics such as root mean squared error (RMSE), mean squared error (MSE), mean absolute error (MAE), the coefficient of determination (R2), maximum error, and minimum error, as well as SAFE metrics (Sustainability, Accuracy, Fairness, Explainability) for a holistic assessment. To ensure a robust comparison, we employed the paired t-test to determine if the differences in model predictions are statistically significant. Additionally, we analyzed correlation metrics using Pearson and Spearman coefficients, which evaluate the models’ ability to capture both linear dependencies and ranking trends in yield fluctuations. This rigorous framework not only benchmarks the predictive power of each model but also provides deeper insights into their effectiveness in forecasting treasury yields across different time horizons. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Deep learning models; Statistical analysis; US treasury yield prediction","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-105011712177"

However, traditional methods often rely on static stop-loss rules paired with separate price prediction models, leading to amplified error propagation in the application of stop-loss orders. We propose a novel end-to-end (E2E) data-driven deep learning framework that simultaneously determines portfolio allocations and stop-loss orders for risky assets, with each asset triggering sales when its prices reach the stop-loss order. The E2E approach uses a two-branch neural network architecture that integrates historical transaction data with additional inputs such as predicted returns and price volatility. A recurrent neural network extracts feature representation vectors for each risky asset from its time series data, and two fully connected layers process the aggregated information to generate the optimal joint action of portfolio allocations and corresponding stop-loss orders. The effectiveness of the E2E solution is demonstrated by numerical experiments on four stock market datasets. The results show that the E2E strategy outperforms alternative benchmarks across multiple metrics, including cumulative returns, alpha returns, and risk-adjusted returns. The strategy exhibits superior ability to maintain robust returns and control tail risk, achieving an average excess return of 0.33% and an average Calmar ratio of 4.50 over four datasets. In addition, the introduction of stop-loss orders yields significantly positive excess returns, and the strategy maintains its advantage even when a transaction cost rate of 0.3% is included. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","End-to-end learning; Portfolio optimization; Recurrent neural network; Stop-loss orders","Electronic trading; Financial markets; Investments; End to end; End-to-end learning; Error propagation; Excess returns; Learning frameworks; Neural-networks; Portfolio optimization; Price prediction models; Risky assets; Stop-loss orders; Costs","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-105009613641"

The empirical results show that the weekly online inflation significantly predicts the yield curve, especially the slope factor, whereas the monthly official inflation cannot predict the yield curve and is instead predicted by the yield curve factors. The mechanism analysis reveals that, due to low price stickiness, online inflation is more sensitive to short-term economic fluctuations and better reflects money market liquidity, thereby having significant predictive power for short-term interest rates and the slope factor. Specifically, online inflation for non-durable goods and on weekdays shows stronger predictive power for the slope factor.

The average R-squared values were 96.25% for the Nelson-Siegel model and 98.75% for the Nelson-Siegel-Svensson model. However, neither model consistently achieved high R-squared values across the entire sample period. The Nelson-Siegel-Svensson model demonstrated greater consistency in R-squared values compared to the Nelson-Siegel model throughout the period.

Generally, AI works as a promising tool that can be used by both dental professionals and patients. For dental professionals, it predicts the risk of dental caries by analyzing dental caries risk and protective factors, enabling to formulate personalized preventive measures. AI, especially those based on machine learning and deep learning, can also analyze images to detect signs of dental caries, assist in developing treatment plans, and help to make a risk assessment for pulp exposure during treatment. AI-powered tools can also be used to train dental students through simulations and virtual case studies, allowing them to practice and refine their clinical skills in a risk-free environment. Additionally, AI tracks brushing patterns and provides feedback to improve oral hygiene practices of the patients and the general population, thereby improving their understanding and compliance.

Efficiency is measured by the return's degree of multifractality, calculated from the multifractal detrended fluctuation analysis method. For the S&P 500 index during the 1951–2022 period, the results show that market efficiency varies over time, with recurrent periods of statistically significant inefficiency (multifractality). Moments of inefficiency are associated with (i) a higher level of financial uncertainty—financial uncertainty Granger causes the degree of multifractality (inefficiency), (ii) a greater variability in the patterns of dependence of returns and also (iii) with periods of more relevant volatility clusters. In times of market inefficiency (efficiency), the use of financial (technical) indicators shows statistically significant in-sample and out-of-sample accuracy for equity risk premium prediction. When the market is efficient (inefficient), the use of financial (technical) indicators should be avoided due to the degradation of their predictive capacity. To build accurate and statistically significant predictions of the risk premium, thus enhancing decision-making processes, investors should monitor the informational efficiency status of the market before selecting financial and technical indicators as predictive variables. Finally, during market inefficiency periods, there is a greater polarisation of investors' opinions, with increased attention to fundamental variables for risk premium prediction, leading to a breakdown in price trend patterns, explaining the worst predictive capacity of technical indicators. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","equity market; forecasting; market efficiency; MF-DFA; risk premium","decision making; equity; market conditions","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85207528014"

One area of concern for current and potential crypto users and investors is their unprecedented price volatility. As cryptos become interlinked with the regulated financial system, questions emerge regarding the possibility of linkages of their prices to the external environments. Financial and macroeconomic factors of inflation, economic growth, interest rates, currency exchange rates, equity market returns, corporate bond yields, gold and oil prices are examined against the cryptocurrency returns. This study encompasses a multi-analytical approach, firstly with the empirical tests of Spearman’s correlational analysis to discover the most pertinent relationships, followed by the PCA analysis to reduce redundancy. The predictive regression model of the Granger Causality test, a vector autoregression (VAR) time series forecasting method, is applied to examine whether the highly effective factors Granger cause the crypto price movements. The Machine Learning Random Forest Regression is also applied where a nuanced understanding of the external factors affecting cryptos prices is gained. The findings of this study pertain to more recent times when the pandemic crisis has subsided and stable economies are in place. The results examined four major cryptos of Bitcoin, Binance Coin, Ripple and Tether, where most behaviours suggest that users and investors are willing to take on riskier assets during periods of economic growth, a strong equity market complements crypto demands and gold and oil are good substitutes for cryptos. Tether, a stablecoin, was the least impacted by external factors and behaved similarly to a fiat currency.

This study aims to apply Monte Carlo simulation to solve three classic probabilistic paradoxes and discuss their implementation in corporate financial management. The article presents Monte Carlo simulation as an advanced tool for risk management in financial management processes. This method allows for a comprehensive risk analysis of financial forecasts, making it possible to assess potential errors in cash flow forecasts and predict the value of corporate treasury growth under various future scenarios. In the investment decision-making process, Monte Carlo simulation supports the evaluation of the effectiveness of financial projects by calculating the expected net value and identifying the risks associated with investments, allowing more informed decisions to be made in project implementation. The method is used in reducing cash flow volatility, which contributes to lowering the cost of capital and increasing the value of a company. Simulation also enables more accurate liquidity planning, including forecasting cash availability and determining appropriate financial reserves based on probability distributions. Monte Carlo also supports the management of credit and interest rate risk, enabling the simulation of the impact of various economic scenarios on a company’s financial obligations. In the context of strategic planning, the method is an extension of decision tree analysis, where subsequent decisions are made based on the results of earlier ones. Creating probabilistic models based on Monte Carlo simulations makes it possible to take into account random variables and their impact on key financial management indicators, such as free cash flow (FCF). Compared to traditional methods, Monte Carlo simulation offers a more detailed and precise approach to risk analysis and decision-making, providing companies with vital information for financial management under uncertainty. This article emphasizes that the use of Monte Carlo simulation in financial management not only enhances the effectiveness of risk management, but also supports the long-term growth of corporate value. The entire process of financial management is able to move into the future based on predicting future free cash flows discounted at the cost of capital. We used both numerical and analytical methods to solve veridical paradoxes. Veridical paradoxes are a type of paradox in which the result of the analysis is counterintuitive, but turns out to be true after careful examination. This means that although the initial reasoning may lead to a wrong conclusion, a correct mathematical or logical analysis confirms the correctness of the results. An example is Monty Hall’s problem, where the intuitive answer suggests an equal probability of success, while probabilistic analysis shows that changing the decision increases the chances of winning. We used Monte Carlo simulation as the numerical method. The following analytical methods were used: conditional probability, Bayes’ rule and Bayes’ rule with multiple conditions. We solved truth-type paradoxes and discovered why the Monty Hall problem was so widely discussed in the 1990s. We differentiated Monty Hall problems using different numbers of doors and prizes. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Bayes’ rule; Bayes’ rule with multiple conditions; Bertrand’s box paradox; conditional probability; corporate treasury management; managing forecasting risk; Monte Carlo simulation; Monty Hall problem; three prisoners dilemma; truth-type paradox","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-105009279401"

Estimating cotton N requirements is crucial, as growers often apply excessive N, exceeding the amount needed for maximum yield. By comparing the Mean Absolute Error (MAE) between predicted and observed cotton yield values across three ML algorithms, i.e., Random Forest (RF), XGBoost, and LightGBM, the RF model achieved the lowest error (422.6 kg/ha), outperforming XGBoost (446 kg/ha) and LightGBM (449 kg/ha). Additionally, the RF model exhibited high sensitivity to N fertilization, ranking N as the most influential variable in feature importance analysis. Furthermore, phosphorus (P) availability in the soil model was found to be a significant factor influencing the RF yield model, highlighting P’s crucial role in cotton growth and productivity. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","cotton; machine learning; mechanistic modeling; nitrogen fertilization; SHAP analysis","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-105009251145"

Traditional cyber security systems use various preventive measures to secure the information and trust authentication methods are used to provide the essential security measure against cyber attacks. These methods are efficient and are also equipped to perform in real-world scenarios. However, the conventional cyber security system does not provide essential security against all types of cyber attacks as they are nature-distributed for controlling the systems. Securing these Distributed Control Systems is highly significant for providing a secure and risk-free operation of the connected systems from cyber attacks and other threats. Therefore, a novel method of risk prediction and risk mitigation is developed using the heuristic-based Hybrid Deep Weighted Networks for protecting the data in the information system. The recommended work is based on risk analysis and a cyber security framework built around the information technology security system. This model aimed to design the cyber security system by mitigating all the threats in that particular information system. The main aim is to predict the risk level and mitigate the security threats completely from the system. To achieve this, initially, the data are gathered from different sources and given to the HDWN. The HDWN is developed by combining the Deep Belief Network and a Recurrent Neural Network. These two networks help to predict the risk values of the threat. To attain the enhanced results, the parameters in this model are optimized by using a hybrid algorithm known as African Vultures with Water Wave Optimization, which is developed by combining the Water Wave Optimization algorithm with the African Vulture Optimization Algorithm. Another intention of this model is to mitigate the threat present in the system. Based on the predicted risk value, the system generates warning signals to alert the admin to block the communication. Thus, the threat and risk from the system are predicted and mitigated without interrupting the system’s performance. Finally, the performance validation is performed on the developed model by comparing it with diverse approaches, and the results demonstrate that the proposed model provides impressive outcomes in ensuring data security. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","African vulture with water wave optimization; Cyber security; Deep belief network; Hybrid deep weighted network; Information system; Recurrent neural network; Risk-level prediction; Threat mitigation","Authentication; Belief propagation; Computer control systems; Cyber attacks; Electronic assessment; Intelligent systems; Neural networks; Risk analysis; Sensitive data; Technological forecasting; African vulture with water wave optimization; Cyber security; Deep belief networks; Hybrid deep weighted network; Neural-networks; Optimisations; Risk levels; Risk-level prediction; Threats mitigations; Weighted networks; Risk assessment","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-105003692475"

Even though AI has been rigorously studied for process optimization, wastage reduction, and other quintessential aspects of the manufacturing industry, there has been limited focus on worker safety as a theme in the current literature. Safety standards contribute to worker safety, but there is no one-size-fits-all approach in these standards or policies, which warrants evaluation and integration of new ideas and technologies to reach the closest to ideal standards. This includes but is not limited to health, regulation of operations, predictive maintenance, and automation and control. The rise of Industry 4.0 and the migration towards Industry 5.0 facilitate easy integration of advanced technologies like AI into the manufacturing industry with real-time predictive capabilities, and this can help reduce human errors and mitigate hazards in processes where sensitivity is crucial or hazards are frequent. Keeping the future outlook in focus, AI can contribute to training workers in risk-free environments, promote engineering education for easy adaptation to new technology, and reduce resistance to changes in the industry. Furthermore, there is an urgent need for standards and regulations to govern and integrate AI technologies judiciously into the manufacturing industry, which holds AI models and their creators accountable for their decisions. This could further extend to preventing the adversarial use of new technology.

Traditional forecasting models face significant limitations in capturing long-term trends, addressing abrupt volatility, and mitigating multi-source noise within complex market environments characterized by nonlinear interactions and extreme events. Current research predominantly focuses on single-model approaches (e.g., ARIMA or standalone neural networks), inadequately addressing the synergistic effects of multimodal market signals (e.g., cross-market index linkages, exchange rate fluctuations, and policy shifts) and lacking the systematic validation of model robustness under extreme events. Furthermore, feature selection often relies on empirical assumptions, failing to uncover non-explicit correlations between market factors and gold futures prices. A review of the global literature reveals three critical gaps: (1) the insufficient integration of temporal dependency and global attention mechanisms, leading to imbalanced predictions of long-term trends and short-term volatility; (2) the neglect of dynamic coupling effects among cross-market risk factors, such as energy ETF-metal market spillovers; and (3) the absence of hybrid architectures tailored for high-frequency noise environments, limiting predictive utility for decision support. This study proposes a three-stage LSTM–Transformer–XGBoost fusion framework. Firstly, XGBoost-based feature importance ranking identifies six key drivers from thirty-six candidate indicators: the NASDAQ Index, S&P 500 closing price, silver futures, USD/CNY exchange rate, China’s 1-year Treasury yield, and Guotai Zhongzheng Coal ETF. Second, a dual-channel deep learning architecture integrates LSTM for long-term temporal memory and Transformer with multi-head self-attention to decode implicit relationships in unstructured signals (e.g., market sentiment and climate policies). Third, rolling-window forecasting is conducted using daily gold futures prices from the Shanghai Futures Exchange (2015–2025). Key innovations include the following: (1) a bidirectional LSTM–Transformer interaction architecture employing cross-attention mechanisms to dynamically couple global market context with local temporal features, surpassing traditional linear combinations; (2) a Dynamic Hierarchical Partition Framework (DHPF) that stratifies data into four dimensions (price trends, volatility, external correlations, and event shocks) to address multi-driver complexity; (3) a dual-loop adaptive mechanism enabling endogenous parameter updates and exogenous environmental perception to minimize prediction error volatility. This research proposes innovative cross-modal fusion frameworks for gold futures forecasting, providing financial institutions with robust quantitative tools to enhance asset allocation optimization and strengthen risk hedging strategies. It also provides an interpretable hybrid framework for derivative pricing intelligence. Future applications could leverage high-frequency data sharing and cross-market risk contagion models to enhance China’s influence in global gold pricing governance. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","deep learning framework; gold futures price forecasting; LSTM–transformer hybrid model; multi-head self-attention architecture; XGBoost machine learning","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-105006731306"

The application of PCA maximizes the explained variance of a linear combination of bond yields by selecting weights that are as uncorrelated as possible. In the context of factor construction, this choice of weights imposes orthogonality on the state variable bringing about restrictions on model estimation. We quantify the effect of these restrictions, measured through internal consistency equations, on the empirical performance of DTSM contained within linear-affine and linear-quadratic state space formulations (SSF) characterized by Gaussian and non-Gaussian transition dynamics for the state variable. When looking across DTSM, we find the smallest effect of restrictions imposed by PCA on empirical performance when it is used in the context of a linear-affine SSF, and the state transition dynamics are postulated based upon the conditional mean and variance. We also document that the magnitude of this effect is more pronounced when the probability distribution for the data is described by the first four moments relative to just the first two and the parameter dependencies defining the relationship between bond yields and factors are more analytically or computationally complicated (e.g., involves a special function like the Bessel function or cumbersome algebraic manipulations).

Unfortunately, the native forecasting features of the SAP ERP are often constrained by outdated input streams, static data assumptions, and rigid model structures, severely impeding responsiveness and accuracy. This study proposes and evaluates the results-focused integration of UiPath robotic process automation (RPA) with predictive analytics to improve short and medium-term cash flow forecasting in SAP environments. We automated real-time data extraction from SAP FI, FI-CA, and bank interface modules, then employed machine learning and deep learning models (regression trees, LSTM networks, and ensemble methods) to demonstrate substantial gains in forecasting accuracy, cycle time, and exception handling. The framework was tested on large data sets from multi-currency, multi-business unit enterprises, achieving forecast accuracy improvement estimates of 15% to 28% compared to SAP’s baseline predictions. Aside from significantly reducing manual effort associated with forecast preparation, automation also expedited scenario-based liquidity analysis while enhancing governance through exception-based audit logging. These results provide a proven scaling architecture for intelligent real-time cash forecasting that is reliable and compliant, placing RPA and AI at the core of cash management operations of the future, and integrating deeply within ERP systems. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Cash Flow Forecasting; Predictive Analytics; SAP ERP; Treasury Management; UiPath Automation","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-105010042509"

Firstly, based on operational risk theory, market risk, research and development risk, financial risk, and human resource risk are selected as the primary indicators for enterprise risk assessment. Secondly, the Criteria Importance Through Intercriteria Correlation (CRITIC) weight method is employed to determine the importance of these risk indicators, thereby enhancing the model’s prediction ability and stability. Following this, the FCM clustering algorithm is utilized for pre-processing sample data to improve the efficiency and accuracy of data classification. Finally, an improved RF model is constructed by optimizing the parameters of the RF algorithm. The data selected is mainly from RESSET/DB, covering the issuance, trading, and rating data of fixed-income products such as bonds, government bonds, and corporate bonds, and provides basic information, net value, position, and performance data of funds. The experimental results show that the model achieves an F1 score of 87.26%, an accuracy of 87.95%, an Area under the Curve (AUC) of 91.20%, a precision of 89.29%, and a recall of 87.48%. They are respectively 6.45%, 4.45%, 5.09%, 4.81%, and 3.83% higher than the traditional RF model. In this study, an improved RF model based on FCM clustering is successfully constructed, and the accuracy of risk early warning models and their ability to handle complex data are significantly improved. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","","algorithm; article; clustering algorithm; data classification; fuzzy c means clustering; human; prediction; random forest; risk assessment; cluster analysis; fuzzy logic; procedures; Algorithms; Cluster Analysis; Fuzzy Logic; Humans; Random Forest; Risk Assessment","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-86000779156"

Specifically, MSFCE designs a multi-scale feature encoder to capture both intraday and daily features, which are processed through a Transformer-based dimensionally adaptive encoder. Furthermore, the framework leverages higher-order interactions among technical indicators via a graph attention network, dynamically modeling their interdependencies to improve prediction robustness in dynamic markets. Extensive experiments on the SSE50 and CSI300 datasets demonstrate that MSFCE significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods, consistently exhibiting superior performance across multiple test periods and market conditions.

The study further augments the literature by extending the standard UIP hypothesis to account for the monetary policy stance and risk premium. The estimates of nonlinear autoregressive distributed lag (NARDL) and component generalised autoregressive conditional heteroscedasticity (C-GARCH) show that the UIP hypothesis does not exist in any of the BRICS economies. Nevertheless, after accounting for the risk premium and monetary policy stance using inflation levels, the interest rate differential significantly and positively influences the expected changes in the spot exchange rates. This indicates three important aspects: first, the necessity of risk premium to make up for the higher risk that comes with holding the foreign bond for the benefit of domestic investors. Second that the UIP puzzle does not hold, such that higher interest differential depreciates the domestic currency. Third, the analysis underscores the substantial and direct impact of US inflation level, particularly for Brazil, Russia and India, in determining the changes in the spot exchange rate.

In this context, this paper aims to investigate the connectedness between the two pioneering bond market classes that are conventional and treasury, with the green bonds market. Design/methodology/approach: In their forecasting target, authors use a Support Vector Regression model on daily S&P 500 Green, Conventional and Treasury Bond Indexes for a year from 2012 to 2022. Findings: Authors argue that conventional bonds could better explain and predict green bonds than treasury bonds for the three studied sub-periods (pre-crisis period, Covid-19 crisis and Covid-19-Russian–Ukrainian crisis period). Furthermore, conventional and treasury bonds lose their forecasting power in crisis framework due to enhancements in market connectedness relationships. This effect makes spillovers in bond markets more sensitive to crisis and less predictable. Furthermore, this research paper indicates that even if the indicators of the COVID-19 crisis have stagnated and the markets have adapted to this rather harsh economic framework, the forecast errors persist higher than in the pre-crisis phase due to the Russian–Ukrainian crisis effect not yet addressed by the literature. Originality/value: This study has several implications for the field of green bond forecasting. It not only illuminates the market participants to the best market forecasters, but it also contributes to the literature by proposing an unadvanced investigation of green bonds forecasting in Crisis periods that could help market participants and market policymakers to anticipate market evolutions and adapt their strategies to period specificities. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Conventional bond; Covid-19 crisis; Green bonds; Russian–Ukrainian crisis; Support vector regression model; Treasury bond","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85195152247"

Since the regulatory method, the Smith-Wilson method, is inconsistent with observable yield curve dynamics, parsimonious parametric models, the Nelson-Siegel model and its extensions, are often used for yield curve extrapolation in risk management. However, it is difficult for the parsimonious parametric models to extrapolate yield curves without excessive volatility because of their limited ability to represent observed yield curves with a limited number of parameters. To extend the representational capabilities, we propose a novel yield curve extrapolation method using machine learning. Using the long short-term memory architecture, we achieve purely data-driven yield curve extrapolation with better generalization performance, stability, and consistency with observed yield curve dynamics than the previous parsimonious parametric models on US and Japanese yield curve data. In addition, our method has model interpretability using the backpropagation algorithm.

Using a state-space model and the Kalman filter, it analyzes data from blockchain-related patents and Google Trends to assess their influence on the excess returns of blockchain-focused exchange-traded funds (ETFs). The findings highlight that innovation activity significantly enhances financial performance, underscoring blockchain's role as a general-purpose technology with transformative sustainability potential. Public attention, measured through search interest, independently drives investor sentiment and market outcomes, while the interaction between innovation and public attention does not exhibit significant synergistic effects, suggesting distinct channels of influence. This study contributes to the growing stream of literature in sustainable finance, innovation management, and behavioral finance by introducing a real-time measure of blockchain innovation for sustainability into an asset pricing model, by showing that patent activity and public attention operate as separate predictors of financial returns, and by advancing methodological practice through the use of a state-space approach to capture latent innovation dynamics. The findings suggest actionable strategies: investors can track patent-based innovation and search trends as early signals of thematic-ETF performance; industry leaders can align blockchain projects with sustainability goals to unlock valuation gains; and policymakers can foster environmental, social, and governance innovation ecosystems by encouraging transparent patent disclosure and public awareness. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Blockchain innovation; exchange-traded funds (ETFs); financial performance; public attention; sustainability","Blockchain; Commerce; Electronic trading; Financial markets; Investments; Patents and inventions; State space methods; Sustainable development goals; Attention performance; Block-chain; Blockchain innovation; Excess returns; Exchange-traded funds; Financial performance; Google trends; Market impacts; Public attention; State-space models; Sustainable development","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-105013522621"

We consider that the financial market is defined by factors and present a regime switching autoregressive model for macro-economic factors to reflect financial cycles. It is assumed that the regime dynamics are Markovian and the parameters in the autoregressive model depend on regime dynamics. We then define a factor model for asset returns, with returns depending on regimes through the factors. The joint distribution of regimes and asset returns is the input to optimal portfolio selection models. Contrasting approaches to risk measurement of returns on investment are variance and exponential Rényi entropy (Rényi, 1960). We compare portfolio models with minimum variance and minimum entropy objectives. In the empirical analysis, we use the select sector ETFs to test the asset pricing model and examine the portfolio performance.

Therefore, in this paper, a novel trading strategy is proposed, grounded in multi-scale deep reinforcement learning and stock price trend prediction, with supervised learning and reinforcement learning unified within a unified framework. Our proposed method is separated into three stages. First, a novel network was designed to predict stock price movement (upward, stationary, or downward) with 67.34% accuracy by combining the strengths of Convolutional Neural Network and Long-Short Term Memory. Second, leveraging the trained trend prediction network, states were enhanced with daily and weekly stock information, and multi-scale and backbone network modules were employed for effective feature extraction. Finally, a Double Deep Q-Network algorithm based on the augmented state was adopted to learn robust trading strategies. This study also contributes to the theoretical advancement of stock price prediction models by introducing a hybrid CNN-LSTM architecture for trend prediction and a multi-scale feature extraction framework for improved decision-making. Experimental results across six U.S. financial assets demonstrate that a notable accuracy of 67.34% for price trend prediction is achieved by our Convolutional Neural Network-Long-Short Term Memory network. Furthermore, the proposed trading strategy outperforms other deep reinforcement learning algorithms, yielding an average annualized return of 44.47%. By comparison, the PPO model achieves 37.60%, the TDQN model achieves 13.38%, the DQN-vanilla model achieves 28.71%, and the DQN-pattern model achieves 22.21%.

Powerful deep learning methods for alpha factor mining lack interpretability, making them unacceptable in the risk-sensitive real markets. Formulaic alpha factors are preferred for their interpretability, while the search space is complex and powerful explorative methods are urged. Recently, a promising framework is proposed for generating formulaic alpha factors using deep reinforcement learning, and quickly gained research focuses from both academia and industries. This paper first argues that the originally employed policy training method, i.e., Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO), faces several important issues in the context of alpha factors mining. Herein, a novel reinforcement learning algorithm based on the well-known REINFORCE algorithm is proposed. REINFORCE employs Monte Carlo sampling to estimate the policy gradient—yielding unbiased but high variance estimates. The minimal environmental variability inherent in the underlying state transition function, which adheres to the Dirac distribution, can help alleviate this high variance issue, making REINFORCE algorithm more appropriate than PPO. A new dedicated baseline is designed to theoretically reduce the commonly suffered high variance of REINFORCE. Moreover, the information ratio is introduced as a reward shaping mechanism to encourage the generation of steady alpha factors that can better adapt to changes in market volatility. Evaluations on real assets data indicate the proposed algorithm boosts correlation with returns by 3.83%, and a stronger ability to obtain excess returns compared to the latest alpha factors mining methods, which meets the theoretical results well. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","computational finance; Markov decision processes; quantitative finance; Reinforcement learning","Financial markets; Investments; Learning algorithms; Monte Carlo methods; Reinforcement learning; Computational finance; Excess profit; Interpretability; Learning methods; Market data; Markov Decision Processes; Policy optimization; Quantitative finance; Real markets; Reinforcement learnings; Deep reinforcement learning","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-105007297220"

Hence, it examines whether the method of deficit financing significantly impacts inflation in Nigeria. Design/methodology/approach: Based on the nature of the study and the availability of data in Nigeria, this study employs the ARDL bound test estimation technique to analyse annual time-series data from 1981 to 2021. Findings: The ARDL bounds test approach to co-integration revealed a long-run co-integrating relationship between Central Bank advances, Treasury bills/bonds, and inflation in Nigeria. Furthermore, the ARDL results provide evidence of a negative and significant relationship between bonds and inflation in both the short and long run. In contrast, Central Bank advances exhibit a statistically significant direct effect on inflation in the short run and an indirect effect in the long run. Research limitations/implications: The study focuses solely on Nigeria, limiting the applicability of the findings to other nations with differing economic structures or fiscal policies. Secondly, while the ARDL bounds testing approach is appropriate for the research context, it may not capture complex nonlinear relationships or structural breaks within the dataset. Lastly, the exclusion of additional potential determinants of inflation, such as external shocks, geopolitical factors, or exchange rate dynamics, could restrict the comprehensiveness of the analysis. Practical implications: This study provides empirical evidence supporting the view that, to achieve lower inflation in Nigeria, policymakers should prioritize using bonds to finance the deficit budget, as they have been shown to have a short-and long-term deflationary effect on the economy. Originality/value: The novelty of this study lies in categorizing deficit budget financing (Central Bank advances and Treasury bills) and identifying which has the greatest impact on inflation in Nigeria. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","ARDL; Bonds; Central Bank advances; Inflation","","Article","aip","","Scopus","2-s2.0-105002467091"

Credit bond defaults not only increase the financing costs of enterprises but also affect the efficiency of debt issuance and even lead to the spread of risks in the financial market. Accurately identifying bond default risks, clarifying the characteristics of bond defaults, and understanding the default risk mechanism are of crucial importance. Methods: This paper takes corporate credit bonds as the research object and analyzes bond defaults from both macro and micro perspectives. From a macro perspective, it confirms the logical transmission between macro factors and bond defaults through causal relationships and grasps the overall characteristics of bond defaults by combining association rule mining and descriptive statistical research methods. Bonds are divided into a risk-free bond group and a risky bond group, and association rules are mined in four dimensions: the bond issuance region of the enterprise, whether the issuer is listed, the attributes of the issuing enterprise, and whether the enterprise bond is guaranteed. Based on these rules, a cross-analysis of bond risk factors is conducted. From a micro perspective, taking each bond as the research object, a bond default identification system is established, and default predictions are made based on the ensemble learning algorithm. The important characteristics of default bonds are analyzed from the perspective of whether the issuer is a state-owned enterprise, and further cause difference analysis is conducted. Results: The results show that M1 and M2 have an impact on bond defaults, and the ensemble machine learning algorithm can accurately predict bond default risks and obtain key factors for bond risk identification. It is reasonable to choose macro indicators to predict bond defaults. Discussion: Based on the experimental conclusions, this paper discusses and analyzes the bond risk evolution process and the reasons for risk concentration in certain industries, which is helpful for a comprehensive understanding of bond default risks. Our research can provide tool references and guidance for risk management in the actual bond market. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","association rule mining; bond credit default prediction; Chinese bond market; combinatorial machine learning; granger causality test; macro factors and default causality","Adversarial machine learning; Financial markets; Risk assessment; Risk management; Bond credit default prediction; Chinese bond market; Combinatorial machine learning; Default risk; Granger causality test; Machine-learning; Macro factor and default causality; Research object; Risk factors; Rule mining; Commerce","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-105002254323"

Long waiting times negatively affect patient experience and hospital performance. Addressing these issues requires accurate system time predictions and actionable strategies. This paper presents a hybrid framework combining predictive modeling and optimization to reduce system times and enhance satisfaction, focusing on registration, vitals, and doctor consultation. We evaluated three predictive models: multiple linear regression (MLR), log-transformed regression (LTMLR), and artificial neural networks (ANN). The MLR model had the best performance, with an (Formula presented.) of 0.93, an MAE of 7.29 min, and an RMSE of 9.57 min. MLR was chosen for optimization due to its accuracy and efficiency, making it ideal for implementation. The hybrid framework combines the MLR model with a simulation-based optimization system to reduce waiting and processing times, considering resource constraints like staff and patient load. Simulating various scenarios, the framework identifies key bottlenecks and allocates resources effectively. Reducing registration and doctor consultation wait times were identified as primary areas for improvement. Efficiency factors were applied to optimize waiting and processing times. These factors include increasing staff during peak hours, improving workflows, and automating tasks. As a result, registration wait time decreased by 15%, vitals by 20%, and doctor consultation by 25%. Processing times improved by 10–15%, leading to an average reduction of 22.5 min in total system time. This paper introduces a hybrid decision support system that integrates predictive analytics with operational improvements. By combining the MLR model with simulation, healthcare managers can predict patient times and test strategies in a risk-free, simulated environment. This approach allows real-time decision-making and scenario exploration without disrupting operations. This methodology highlights how reducing waiting times has a direct impact on patient satisfaction and hospital operational efficiency, offering an applicable solution that does not require significant structural changes. The results are practical and implementable in resource-constrained healthcare environments, allowing for optimized staff management and patient flow. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","healthcare operations efficiency; patient satisfaction; predictive modeling; simulation-based decision support; wait-time optimization","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85211951995"

We study whether emissions are priced by financial markets, providing a market-based incentive for firms to reduce their carbon footprints and if the heightened attention on climate change post-Paris Accord (PA) impacts the size of the “carbon risk premium.” We focus on electricity generators, because they are responsible for the largest share of emissions and emissions reductions in the U.S. and are highly exposed to regulatory, physical, and stranded asset risks. We find the cost of carbon risk is reflected in the returns of vertically integrated electric utilities. The post-PA period provides the strongest evidence that carbon risk is priced. We find that equity markets provide incentives for power producers to reduce emissions, as reductions in emissions are associated with reductions in required returns on equity (increases in equity market values). The challenge for regulators is how to respond in rate cases. Lowering a utility's regulated return to reflect lower market estimates of the return on equity would dilute the market-based incentive for emissions reductions. Adding a longer-term return incentive for continued investment in emissions reductions would reinforce the market incentive. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Carbon emissions; Carbon premium; Climate risk; Cost of capital; Greenhouse gas; Stock returns","Low emission; Carbon emissions; Carbon premium; Climate risk; Cost of capital; Emission reduction; Equity markets; Greenhouse gas emissions; Greenhouses gas; Risk premium; Stock returns; carbon emission; carbon footprint; electricity generation; emission control; financial market; greenhouse gas; incentive; investment; United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change; United States","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85203619130"

This paper presents a new framework for learning textual data based on the factor augmentation model and sparsity regularization, called the factor-augmented regularized model for prediction (FarmPredict), to let machines learn financial returns directly from news. FarmPredict allows the model itself to extract information directly from articles without predefined information, such as dictionaries or pretrained models as in most studies. Using unsupervised learned factors to augment the predictors would benefit our method with a ""doublerobust""feature: that the machine would learn to balance between individual words or text factors/topics. It also avoids the information loss of factor regression in dimensionality reduction. We apply our model to the Chinese stock market with a large proportion of retail investors by using Chinese news data to predict financial returns. We show that positive sentiments scored by our FarmPredict approach from news generate on average 83 basic points (bps) stock daily excess returns, and negative news has an adverse impact of 26 bps on the days of news announcements, where both effects can last for a few days. This asymmetric effect aligns well with the short-sale constraints in the Chinese equity market. The result shows that the machine-learned prediction does provide sizeable predictive power with an annualized return of 54% at most with a simple investment strategy. Compared with other statistical and machine learning methods, FarmPredict significantly outperforms them on model prediction and portfolio performance.

This study investigates the performance of ML methods when predicting different measures of stock returns from various factor models and investigates the feature importance and interaction effects among firm-specific variables and macroeconomic factors in this context. Our findings reveal that neural network models exhibit consistent performance across different stock return measures when they rely solely on firm-specific characteristic variables. However, the inclusion of macroeconomic factors from the financial market, real economic activities, and investor sentiment leads to substantial improvements in the model performance. Notably, the degree of improvement varies with the specific measures of stock returns under consideration. Furthermore, our analysis indicates that, after the inclusion of macroeconomic factors, there is a dissimilarity in model performance, variable importance, and interaction effects among macroeconomic and firm-specific variables, particularly concerning abnormal returns derived from the Fama–French three- and five-factor models compared with excess returns. This divergence is primarily attributed to the extent to which these factor models remove the variance associated with the macroeconomic variables.

The WTI price forecasting utilizes data on spot gold price, US 10-year bond yield, global economic activity, and US dollar index from January 1986 to May 2023. The model's performance is assessed using measures such as MAE, MSE, RMSE, MAPE, and R2 metrics. The results generated by the proposed new model are compared to those of the existing machine and deep learning methods, and it is observed that the new model performs better than the existing models in all statistical tests. The study further examined the decision-making processes of the model using SHAP analysis and assessed the individual contribution of each feature to the model's predictions. The correlation between the US Dollar Index and Gold prices and WTI crude oil prices is evident. The SHAP research has demonstrated that the model effectively captures complicated economic linkages and enhances the accuracy of forecasts. The results of this study enhance the development of models that are capable of predicting results, even in times of significant instability, such as economic crises.

We introduce a new high-dimensional statistical method, the Quantile Group Adaptive Lasso, designed to accurately predict the returns of this index. Our empirical results demonstrate that this model surpasses several established forecasting techniques in both accuracy and stability. Furthermore, our analysis of economic significance highlights the critical influence of traditional energy-related predictors from G7 and BRICS countries on the global green bond markets. We also find that monetary policies and macroeconomic factors, such as M2 money supply, CPI, and government bond yields, play vital roles. Additionally, the robustness of our proposed method is confirmed.

We suggest that this correlation is driven by mispricing rather than risk premium. Specifically, we argue that investors' difficulties in accurately assessing firm-level productivity and limited attention result in the inadequate incorporation of this information into stock prices. Furthermore, our analysis explores additional factors contributing to the observed productivity-related market anomaly, including investor overconfidence, positive feedback trading, lottery preference, information uncertainty, and limits to arbitrage, indicating investors' irrationality and behavioral biases.

H.halys is an invasive species originating from East Asia, that is extremely polyphagous and poses a significant threat to various crops. Our first contribution is a drone navigation protocol, which ensures risk-free drone flights in cluttered orchard environments, preserving image quality and avoiding obstacles. We then create a pioneering H.halys dataset consisting of aerial telephotos captured in the field autonomously by the drone. The dataset allows the development and evaluation for the first time of multiple ML models for H.halys detection in the field. We trained YOLOV5, YOLOV8, RETINANET, and FASTER-RCNN models using different learning methodologies, exploiting different percentages of images without the bug, and using different slicing procedures for the images. The Medium YOLOV5 model trained with all images containing a bug detects the largest number of H.halys on the testing set and overall performs the best, while RETINANET and FASTER-RCNN provide the best trade-off between precision and recall. Models vary in their ability to handle occluded H.halys and bug-free images, which are common since the presence of the bug cannot be predicted before capturing a photo. These results show promising potential for automating H.halys monitoring, despite the image complexity and the early dataset stage. Our work marks a significant step towards enhancing smart agriculture practices due to the simplicity of the data acquisition process and the off-the-shelf hardware selection. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Computer vision algorithm; Drones; Halyomorpha halys detection; Technological transfer","Ability testing; Aerial photography; Aircraft detection; Digital storage; Drones; Image enhancement; Avoiding obstacle; Computer vision algorithms; East Asia; Halyomorpha haly detection; Invasive species; Neural-networks; Risk free; Stink bugs; Technological transfer; Testing sets; Orchards; aerial photograph; artificial neural network; computer vision; data acquisition; detection method; invasive species; technological change; Far East","Article","Final","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85202194488"

To overcome this challenge, we propose a three-level nested portfolio optimization model with position allocation. Within this model, the inner and middle levels collaboratively determine the optimal portfolio, while the outer level focuses on optimizing the holding proportion of each stock in the optimal portfolio. Compared with existing models with portfolio weights, the proposed model imposes the position allocation constraint that precisely characterizes the limitations on holding each stock. This constraint is crucial for investors to obey securities trading regulations involving position limitations and to mitigate the potential impact of market risks. To address the nonlinear and nonconvex nature of the novel model, we develop an intelligent optimization algorithm by effectively hybridizing the support vector regression and the enhanced grey wolf optimizer. We comprehensively evaluate its performance using eight metrics, including accumulative return, annual return, Sharpe ratio, maximum drawdown, absolute and relative win ratios, predictive precision and accuracy. The experimental results indicate that (i) the proposed model can achieve more excess returns than those stock selection models not considering position allocation, especially for the large-cap stocks; (ii) compared with other state-of-the-art meta-heuristics, the enhanced grey wolf optimizer can yield better portfolio in conjunction with the support vector regression; (iii) in the context of the Chinese A-share stock market, specific financial indicators such as return on equity, inventory turnover rate, net income growth rate, and debt-to-equity ratio should be given greater consideration compared to other financial metrics. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Grey wolf optimizer; Portfolio optimization; Position allocation; Support vector regression","Commerce; Electronic trading; Growth rate; Investments; Optimization; Gray wolf optimizer; Gray wolves; Optimal portfolios; Optimizers; Portfolio optimization; Portfolio optimization models; Position allocation; Securities trading; Support vector regressions; Three-level; Financial markets","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85200798925"

However, in more recent years, this topic has received far less attention. Accordingly, this study seeks to “update” the findings of such studies and to do so for the dominant North American economies of Canada and the U.S. Furthermore, in the pursuit of further insights into interest rates, the present study also investigates an effectively heretofore overlooked variable that arguably also might influence interest rates, namely, economic freedom. Finally, given the increased upward trend of government debt (relative to GDP) in recent years in Canada and the U.S., this study investigates the interest rate impact of rising national debt-to-GDP ratios. For the 1995–2024 period (and also in one estimate for the 1985–2001 period), this exploratory study finds compelling evidence (1) that the real interest rate yield on 10-year Treasuries in Canada and the real interest rate yield on 10-year U.S. Treasury notes are increasing functions of the central government budget deficits in both Canada and the U.S., respectively, and (2) the real interest rate yields on 10-year Treasuries in Canada and 10-year U.S. Treasury notes are both decreasing functions of economic freedom in Canada and the U.S., respectively. On the other hand, regarding the impact of a higher national debt-to-GDP ratio on the real ten-year Treasury yield, there is only very mixed support for an impact, with support for its impact coming from the Canadian estimates but no support whatsoever coming from the U.S. estimates. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","economic freedom; elevated national debt-to-GDP ratios; government budget deficit; real interest rate yield","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85207514929"

However, access to stable and affordable finance varies dramatically across countries. Models used to evaluate the energy transition do not differentiate regional financing costs and therefore cannot study risk-sharing mechanisms for renewable electricity generation. In this study, we incorporated the empirically estimated cost of capital differentiated by country and technology into an ensemble of five climate–energy–economy models. We quantified the additional financing cost of decarbonization borne by developing regions and explored policies of risk premium convergence across countries. We found that alleviating financial constraints benefits both climate and equity as a result of more renewable and affordable energy in the developing world.

Although traditional educational tools in the field of radiology are essential, it is necessary to capitalize on the innovative and emerging educational applications of extended reality (XR) technologies. At the most basic level of learning anatomy, XR has been extensively used with an emphasis on its superiority over conventional learning methods, especially in spatial understanding and recall. For imaging interpretation, XR has fostered the concepts of virtual reading rooms by enabling collaborative learning environments and enhancing image analysis and understanding. Moreover, image-guided interventions in interventional radiology have witnessed an uptick in XR utilization, illustrating its effectiveness in procedural training and skill acquisition for medical students and residents in a safe and risk-free environment. However, there remain several challenges and limitations for XR in radiology education, including technological, economic, and ergonomic challenges and and integration into existing curricula. This review explores the transformative potential of MXR in radiology education and training along with insights on the future of XR in radiology education, forecasting advancements in immersive simulations, artificial intelligence integration for personalized learning, and the potential of cloud-based XR platforms for remote and collaborative training. In summation, MXR's burgeoning role in reshaping radiology education offers a safer, scalable, and more efficient training model that aligns with the dynamic healthcare landscape. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","augmented reality; medical education; mixed reality; radiology training; virtual reality","artificial intelligence; augmented reality; cloud computing; collaborative learning; education; forecasting; human; image analysis; interventional radiology; learning environment; medical education; medical student; radiology; review; simulation; training; virtual reality; curriculum; Augmented Reality; Curriculum; Humans; Radiology; Virtual Reality","Review","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85199146384"

Today, the pharmaceutical industry uses the most active plant compounds in drug synthesis. Possible high levels of naturally occurring radionuclides in medicinal plants have raised public concern about the consequent radiological impact on the consumption of medicinal plants and herbs. This paper reports the first study of soil-to-plant mobilities of natural radionuclides in native medicinal plants in Malaysia. Representative samples of soils and organically grown traditional medicinal plants from western Malaysia were collected and studied using HPGe gamma-ray spectrometry. Average activity concentrations for 226Ra, 228Ra, and 40K in the soils are respectively 57, 84, and 520 Bq/kg, and the respective values in the medicinal plants are 10, 4, and 498 Bq/kg. The respective transfer factors (TFs) for the medicinal leaves are 0.18, 0.05, and 1.18. The TFs of 40K were higher than others due to higher uptake and its essentiality in plant growth. These findings indicate that plant growth habits greatly influenced the radionuclides' uptake. The radioactivities in soils and their corresponding mobilities are in accordance with literature data. To discard any radiological hazards to human health, the estimated threshold consumption rate is found to be approximately 46 kg/y. Annual effective doses and excess lifetime cancer risk for adult members of the public due to the consumption of medicinal plants are found to be negligible. It is suggested that the use of traditional medicinal plants may provide a risk-free and safe means of maintaining public health. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Annual effective dose; Medicinal plant; Natural radioactivity; Physicochemical property; Traditional medicine; Transfer factor","Diseases; Gamma ray spectrometers; Germanium compounds; Health hazards; Health risks; Medical applications; Phosphorus compounds; Physicochemical properties; Plants (botany); Radioisotopes; Risk perception; Soil pollution; Annual effective dose; Malaysia; Malaysians; Medicinal plants; Natural radioactivity; Physicochemical property; Plant growth; Traditional medicinal plants; Traditional medicine; Transfer Factor; Soils; dissolved organic matter; potassium; potassium 40; radioisotope; radium 226; radium 228; adult; agricultural chemistry; Article; calibration; cancer risk; cation exchange capacity; climate change; controlled study; drug dosage form; drug industry; drug synthesis; economic aspect; environmental factor; excess lifetime cancer risk; food analysis; food intake; gamma radiation; gamma spectrometry; geographic distribution; habitat quality; hazard ratio; health risk assessment; herbal medicine; human; Malaysian; medicinal plant; pH measurement; plant growth; plant physiology; public health; radioactivity; radiological procedures; radionuclide therapy; self fertilization; soil analysis; threshold consumption rate; traditional medicine","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85197039271"

In this study, we adapted this methodology to credit risk assessment. We used a comprehensive dataset from the Estonian P2P lending platform Bondora, consisting of over 350,000 loans and 112 features with a loan volume of 915 million euros. First, we applied classical (linear) and machine learning (extreme gradient-boosted) Cox models to estimate the risk of these loans and then risk-rated them using risk stratification. For each rating category we calculated default rates, rates of return, and plotted Kaplan–Meier curves. These performance criteria revealed that the boosted Cox model outperformed both the classical Cox model and the platform’s rating. For instance, the boosted model’s highest rating category had an annual excess return of 18% and a lower default rate compared to the platform’s best rating. Second, we explained the machine learning model’s output using Shapley Additive Explanations. This analysis revealed novel nonlinear relationships (e.g., higher risk for borrowers over age 55) and interaction effects (e.g., between age and housing situation) that provide promising avenues for future research. The machine-learning model also found feature contributions aligning with existing research, such as lower default risk associated with older borrowers, females, individuals with mortgages, or those with higher education. Overall, our results reveal that explainable machine learning survival analysis excels at risk rating, profit scoring, and risk factor analysis, facilitating more precise and transparent credit risk assessments. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Cox model; Credit risk; Explainable AI; G10; G21; G32; G33; G51; P2P lending; SHAP; Survival analysis","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85208063837"

The objective is to develop a new class of covariance regression factor models for covariance forecasting, along with a library of portfolio allocation tools that integrate with this new covariance forecasting framework. The novelty is in two stages: the type of covariance regression model and factor extractions used to construct the covariates used in the covariance regression, along with a powerful portfolio allocation framework for dynamic multi-period asset investment management. The major contributions of package CovRegpy can be found on the GitHub repository for this library in the scripts: CovRegpy.py, CovRegpy_DCC.py, CovRegpy_RPP.py, CovRegpy_SSA.py, CovRegpy_SSD.py, and CovRegpy_X11.py. These six scripts contain implementations of software features including multivariate covariance time series models based on the regularized covariance regression (RCR) framework, dynamic conditional correlation (DCC) framework, risk premia parity (RPP) weighting functions, singular spectrum analysis (SSA), singular spectrum decomposition (SSD), and X11 decomposition framework, respectively. These techniques can be used sequentially or independently with other techniques to extract implicit factors to use them as covariates in the RCR framework to forecast covariance and correlation structures and finally apply portfolio weighting strategies based on the portfolio risk measures based on forecasted covariance assumptions. Explicit financial factors can be used in the covariance regression framework, implicit factors can be used in the traditional explicit market factor setting, and RPP techniques with long/short equity weighting strategies can be used in traditional covariance assumption frameworks. We examine, herein, two real-world case studies for actuarial practitioners. The first of these is a modification (demonstrating the regularization of covariance regression) of the original example from Hoff & Niu ((2012). Statistica Sinica, 22(2), 729-753) which modeled the covariance and correlative relationship that exists between forced expiratory volume (FEV) and age and FEV and height. We examine this within the context of making probabilistic predictions about mortality rates in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. The second case study is a more complete example using this package wherein we present a funded and unfunded UK pension example. The decomposition algorithm isolates high-, mid-, and low-frequency structures from FTSE 100 constituents over 20 years.

While machine learning models have demonstrated their efficacy in stock price forecasting, they rely solely on historical price data, which, given the inherent volatility and dynamic nature of financial markets, are insufficient to address the complexity and uncertainty in long-term forecasting due to the limited connection between historical and forecasting prices. This paper introduces a pioneering approach that integrates financial theory with advanced deep learning methods to enhance predictive accuracy and risk management in China’s stock index futures market. The SF-Transformer model, combining spot-forward parity and the Transformer model, is proposed to improve forecasting accuracy across short and long-term horizons. Formulated upon the arbitrage-free futures pricing model, the spot-forward parity model offers variables such as stock index price, risk-free rate, and stock index dividend yield for forecasting. Our insight is that the mutual information generated by these variables has the potential to significantly reduce uncertainty in long-term forecasting. A case study on predicting major stock index futures prices in China demonstrates the superiority of the SF-Transformer model over models based on LSTM, MLP, and the stock index futures arbitrage-free pricing model, covering both short and long-term forecasting up to 28 days. Unlike existing machine learning models, the Transformer processes entire time series concurrently, leveraging its attention mechanism to discern intricate dependencies and capture long-range relationships, thereby offering a holistic understanding of time series data. An enhancement of mutual information is observed after introducing spot-forward parity in the forecasting. The variation of mutual information and ablation study results highlights the significant contributions of spot-forward parity, particularly to the long-term forecasting. Overall, these findings highlight the SF-Transformer model’s efficacy in leveraging spot-forward parity for reducing uncertainty and advancing robust and comprehensive approaches in long-term stock index futures price forecasting. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","financial complexity; long-term forecasting; mutual information; stock index futures; transformer","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85197922639"

The use of Machine Learning techniques in stock markets and the treasury (Front–Back Office) of financial institutions is a key tool for optimizing its own resources, internal processes and risk measures. We propose a hybrid methodology to better capture the volatility of market risk factors with Value-at-risk models in periods of stress, but also in periods of stability compared to traditional metrics. This hybrid model uses different types of artificial neural networks and traditional metrics to perform the optimal forecast of volatility applied to the main market risk nodes of the Spanish stock market. We use data from the following main market risk factors: returns on Santander Bank shares, the Spanish Stock Market Index, Euro/Dollar exchange rates and the index that measures the total return performance of a funded long credit position in the on-the-run iTraxx Crossover 5-Year-Index. Our contribution is a hybrid model that combines correct sequential pattern learnings with an improved prediction performance in the volatility of market risk factors.

Hyperparameter tuning through grid search and randomized search was used to optimize model performance. The results demonstrated the efficacy of AI/ML algorithms in predicting temporal, spatial, and industry-specific money-laundering patterns. The random forest classifier achieved 99.99% average accuracy in state prediction, while the gradient boosting regressor and random forest classifier excelled in predicting year and state simultaneously, and credit card transactions, respectively. MLP and CNN showed promise in the context of debit card transactions. The gradient boosting regressor performed competitively with low mean squared error (MSE) (2.9) and the highest R-squared (R2) value of 0.24, showcasing its pattern-capturing proficiency. Logistic regression and random forest classifier performed well in predicting credit card transactions, with area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC_AUC) scores of 0.55 and 0.53, respectively. For debit card prediction, MLP achieved a precision of 0.55 and recall of 0.42, while CNN showed a precision of 0.6 and recall of 0.54, highlighting their effectiveness.

In this article, we propose a novel portfolio construction approach by utilizing a two-stage ensemble model to forecast stock prices and combining the forecasting results with the portfolio optimization. To be specific, there are two phases in the approach: stock prediction and portfolio optimization. The stock prediction has two stages. In the first stage, three neural networks, that is, multilayer perceptron (MLP), gated recurrent unit (GRU), and long short-term memory (LSTM) are used to integrate the forecasting results of four individual models, that is, LSTM, GRU, deep multilayer perceptron (DMLP), and random forest (RF). In the second stage, the time-varying weight ordinary least square model (OLS) is utilized to combine the first-stage forecasting results to obtain the ultimate forecasting results, and then the stocks having a better potential return on investment are chosen. In the portfolio optimization, a diversified mean-variance with forecasting model named DMVF is proposed, in which an average predictive error term is considered to obtain excess returns, and a 2-norm cost function is introduced to diversify the portfolio. Using the historical data from the Shanghai stock exchange as the study sample, the results of the experiments indicate the DMVF model with two-stage ensemble prediction outperforms benchmarks in terms of return and return-risk characteristics. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","ensemble model; mean-variance model; portfolio optimization; stock price prediction","Cost functions; Costs; Electronic trading; Financial markets; Forestry; Investments; Least squares approximations; Long short-term memory; Multilayer neural networks; Multilayers; Ensemble forecasting; Ensemble models; Forecasting models; Hybrid approach; Mean variance model; Multilayers perceptrons; Performance; Portfolio optimization; Stock predictions; Stock price prediction; Forecasting","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85179724555"

I propose a framework suggesting that the two are actually related and, specifically, that procyclical overoptimism can arise rationally from risk-taking incentives. I show that when firms and banks have a limited liability payoff structure, they have lower incentives to pay attention to the aggregate conditions that generate risk. This leads to systematic underestimation of the accumulation of risk during economic booms and overoptimistic beliefs. As a result, agents lend and borrow excessively, further increasing downside risk. Credit cycles driven by this new “uninformed” risk-taking are consistent with existing evidence such as high credit and low-risk premia predicting a higher probability of crises and negative returns for banks. My model suggests that regulating incentives can decrease overoptimistic beliefs and thus mitigate boom-and-bust cycles. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Credit cycles; Expectations; Information; Limited liability; Overoptimism","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85176101825"

The study period covered the scenario of the World Health Organization pandemic declaration around March 2020 at hourly frequency. We have found that the different variants of deep neural network models outperform those of the GARCH family in the sense of the hetorerocedastic error, and absolute and squared error (HSE). Under the sharpe ratio, the volatility forecasting of a uniform portfolio at long horizons systematically outperforms the stablecoin Tether, which is considered here as the risk-free asset. Also, including transaction volume helps reduce the value at risk or loss probability for the uniform portfolio. Moreover, in a minimum variance portfolio, it is observed that before the pandemic declaration, a large proportion of the capital was allocated to bitcoin (BTC). In contrast, after March 2020, the portfolio is more diversified with short positions for BTC. Moreover, the MLP models give the best predictive results, although not statistically different in accuracy compared to the LSTM and LSTM–GARCH versions under the Diebold–Mariano test. In sum, MLP models outperform most stylised financial models and are less computationally expensive than more complex neural networks.

In the euro area, it remained low between 2010 and 2020. The European Central Bank has even had to take action against the emergence of deflation. The situation changed significantly in 2021. Inflation jumped to levels not seen for 40 years in the EU. Our study aims to use artificial intelligence to forecast inflation. We also use artificial intelligence to forecast stock index changes. Based on the forecasts, we propose portfolio reallocation decisions to protect against inflation. The forecasting literature does not address the importance of structural breaks in the time series, which, among other things, can affect both the pattern recognition and prediction capabilities of various machine learning models. The novelty of our study is that we used the Zivot–Andrews unit root test to determine the breakpoints and partitioned the time series into training and testing datasets along these points. We then examined which database partition gives the most accurate prediction. This information can be used to re-balance the portfolio. Two different AI-based prediction algorithms were used (GRU and LSTM), and a hybrid model (LSTM–GRU) was also included to investigate the predictability of inflation. Our results suggest that the average error of the inflation forecast is a quarter of that of the stock market index forecast. Inflation developments have a fundamental impact on equity and government bond returns. If we obtain a reliable estimate of the inflation forecast, we have time to rebalance the portfolio until the inflation shock is incorporated into government bond returns. Our results not only support investment decisions at the national economy level but are also useful in the process of rebalancing international portfolios. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","deep learning; inflation; neural networks; portfolio management; time series forecast; Zivot–Andrews unit root test","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85188966925"

Based on the sample of China’s carbon emission trading pilot market, this paper firstly uses the Augmented Dickey–Fuller test and Autoregressive conditional heteroscedasticity model to test the stationarity and autocorrelation of carbon trading price returns, uses the Generalized Autoregressive Conditional Heteroscedasticity family model to analyze the persistence, risk and asymmetry of carbon trading price return fluctuations, and then proposes a hybrid prediction model neural network (generalized autoregressive conditional heteroscedasticity–long short-term memory network) due to the shortcomings of GARCH models in carbon price fluctuation analysis and prediction. The model is used to predict the carbon trading price. The results show that the carbon trading pilots have different degrees of volatility aggregation characteristics and the volatility persistence is long, among which only the Shanghai and Beijing carbon trading markets have risk premiums. The other pilot returns have no correlation with risks, and the fluctuations of carbon trading prices and returns are asymmetrical. The prediction results of different models show that the root mean square error (RMSE) of Hubei, Shenzhen and Shanghai carbon trading pilots based on the GARCH-LSTM model is significantly lower than that of the single GARCH model, and the RMSE values are reduced by 0.0006, 0.2993 and 0.0151, respectively. The RMSE in the three pilot markets improved by 0.0007, 0.3011 and 0.0157, respectively, compared to the standalone LSTM model. At the same time, compared with the single model, the GARCH-LSTM model significantly increased the R^2 value in Hubei (0.2000), Shenzhen (0.7607), Shanghai (0.0542) and Beijing (0.0595). Therefore, compared with other models, the GARCH-LSTM model can significantly improve the prediction accuracy of carbon price and provide a new idea for scientifically predicting the fluctuation of financial time series such as carbon price. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","carbon price fluctuations; carbon price forecasting; GARCH-LSTM hybrid model; long short-term memory neural network","artificial neural network; carbon emission; emissions trading; ensemble forecasting; environmental modeling; forecasting method; market system; policy making; price dynamics; time series analysis; Beijing [China]; China; Guangdong; Hubei; Shanghai; Shenzhen","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85186126317"

It has been found that all four flood risk factors have statistically significant positive influence on the flood insurance payout in a county. However, the extent of the influence is different for different flood risk factors. Among them, flood exposure has the highest influence on the flood insurance payout, which is followed by the number of mobile homes, infrastructure vulnerability, and social vulnerability. Since the federal flood insurance program in the U.S. has a large debt to the U.S. treasury, the government should plan for effective risk reduction that can reduce the flood insurance payout in future to keep the program solvent. The outcomes of this research are expected to facilitate that decision-making process by providing the empirical relationship between flood risk factors and flood insurance payout. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Causal model; Flood insurance; Flood risk; Mixed effects regression","Decision making; Flood control; Insurance; Risk assessment; Causal modeling; Control variable; Flood risks; Infrastructure vulnerabilities; Mixed effect regression; Mixed effects; Regression modelling; Risk factors; Risks reduction; Social vulnerability; Floods; empirical analysis; flood; government; infrastructure planning; insurance system; regression analysis; risk factor; vulnerability; Article; causal model; community resilience; comparative study; controlled study; disaster mitigation; empirical research; environmental decision making; environmental exposure; financial deficit; flood insurance; flood mitigation; flooding; futurology; histogram; historical research; home; human; infrastructure vulnerability; mixed effects regression model; mobile home; problem solving; random forest; regression model; social vulnerability; socioeconomic vulnerability; United States; forecasting; insurance; risk reduction; Forecasting; Risk Factors; Risk Reduction Behavior","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85182725293"

Several studies have analysed the impact of central bank transparency (CBT) on variables such as inflation volatility, exchange rate volatility, or stock market volatility. One variable that has not received enough attention is interest rate volatility, despite its importance for decision-makers in both financial markets and the real economy. The study uses a panel data set of a maximum of 93 countries over the years 1998–2017. We use panel data estimators (panel fixed effects and fixed effects filter). Our main findings are that CBT helps to reduce the volatility of several interest rates (money market rates, deposit rates, savings rates, Treasury bill yields and government bond yields), while it increases the volatility of monetary policy rates. The results are also significant from an economic point of view, as a small increase in CBT can reduce the variability of treasury bill rates by up to −8.2%, deposit rates by up to −9.1%, money market rates by up to −15.8% and savings rates by up to −20.4%. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","central Bank Independence; central Bank transparency; interest rate volatility; monetary policy","","Article","aip","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85212859950"

A systematic analysis of the relationship between the amount and structure of total credit and banking crises is important for an objective prediction of the influence of potential financial risks. This paper, drawing on data from 15 selected countries, delves into the power of credit indicators in the early warning of banking crises from the perspectives of industrial structure, sector structure, and term structure of credit. Various machine learning methods were used, including Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Decision Tree, Support Vector Machine (SVM), Bagging, and Boosting models. The empirical findings indicate that credit expansion plays a crucial role in triggering banking crises. However, total credit is better suited for the early warning of short-term banking crises, whereas credit structure is more useful for the early warning of long-term banking crises. Moreover, in an early warning system, identifying key early warning indicators is more meaningful than merely increasing the number of indicators. Machine learning can somewhat enhance the early warning power, but it may not always be robust. Therefore, more attention should be paid to potential systemic banking crises resulting from an imbalance in credit structure while regulating the total credit threshold. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","banking crises; credit expansion; structural perspective; transnational empirical evidence","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85210133695"

Our approach consists, first, of forecasting the CDS spread in order to estimate the forecasted CDS term structure. The general regression neural network (GRNN) is used to predict the CDS spread. By checking the accuracy of the prediction, the results show that the GRNN model can be recommended as an effective forecasting tool for CDS spread. Second, the predicted spreads are used to estimate the forecasted CDS term structure using the Nelson–Siegel model. The results show that for Russia, overall, the CDS spreads in the long term are less than those in the short term, which implies that the future outlook is more optimistic, given the events that occurred during the study period, but it still retains the highest level of credit risk compared to other countries. Unlike Brazil, India and South Africa, the future outlook is more pessimistic. For China, the term structure is unstable; in the short term, there is a tendency to reduce the risk, but for longer horizons, the risk will increase. Thus, BRICS countries have different risk profiles depending on investment horizons. The study’s findings help policymakers in developing tailored risk management strategies for BRICS countries and guide investors in making informed credit investment decisions.

In this setting, alpha stands out as one of the most prevalent and refined measures of risk-adjusted return ever postulated, allowing for the estimation of the excess return that cannot be explained by the risk factors impacting an asset. This article introduces a neural network architecture designed to formulate an investment strategy with the explicit goal of maximizing alpha. The strategy, centered around market timing, determines on a daily basis, based on past returns of the risky asset, whether to fully invest in the risky asset or opt for the risk-free alternative. The neural network architecture comprises two components: a policy network for strategy implementation and an evaluation network for long-term alpha computation during parameter optimization. Employing value-weighted US size decile portfolios as risky assets, the study achieves significant out-of-sample alphas ranging from 3.6% to 8.2% per year under the q5 asset pricing model (with a transaction cost assumption of one basis point). By construction, these alphas are not generated by risky asset growth.

In addition, the authors analyze the integration of the commodity, bond, forex and equity markets across these markets. Design/methodology/approach: The dynamic conditional correlation GARCH (DCC-GARCH) model is used to capture the time-varying conditional correlation among markets. The authors use daily data of stock prices, oil prices, gold prices, exchange rates and 10 years' bond yields of the six countries from Datastream and investing.com from January 2001 to April 2021. Findings: Findings reveal that the parameters of dynamic correlation are statistically significant which indicates the importance of time-varying co-movements. Estimation of the DCC-GARCH model suggests that the stock market is significantly correlated with bond, forex, gold and oil markets in all six countries. Practical implications: This study has practical implications for policymakers and investment professionals. A better understanding of dynamic linkages among the markets would help in constructing effective hedging and portfolio diversification strategies. Policy makers can get insight to build proper strategies in order to insulate the economy from factors that cause volatility. Originality/value: Several studies have investigated the linkage between commodity and stock markets and the volatility spillover effect, but very little attention is given to study the interrelationship between groups of market segments of different economies. No study has comparatively examined the dynamic relationship of multiple markets of a group of emerging countries simultaneously. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Commodity market; Conditional correlation; DCC-GARCH; Emerging markets; Forex market; Stock market","","Article","aip","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85197194276"

Different types of Investors may response differently to the dividend policy. For instance, individual investors are insensitive to the dividend policy, while the institutional investors usually prefer to the stocks with stable dividend. Some studies have provided evidences that the unstable dividend may lead to great fluctuations of stock price. In this paper, we attempt to develop a theoretical model based on investor behaviors, and investigate the impacts of dividend policy on price dynamics. In real financial markets, investors are heterogeneous and have asymmetric information. They make trading decisions based on the information they observe and take different trading strategies. Some investors may buy the stock and care about the dividend. Some others may trade based on the fundamentals of the stock. They estimate the fundamental value and buy the stock when the price is below the fundamental value. In this paper, investors are assumed to be boundedly rational, and their behaviors are modeled with the heterogenous agent model. In the model, we consider two types of trading strategies, i. e., the fundamental strategy and the technical strategy. These strategies reflect the heterogeneous expectations of investors. Investors choose between the two strategies according to their performance. The better performance one strategy has, the higher probability the strategy is chosen. The strategy switching mechanism is expressed by the logit response function. It can also depict the dynamics of investor fractions in the market. The price is generated through the trading behaviors of investors. We model the price adjustment process based on the aggregate excess demand. When the aggregate excess demand is positive, the price increases, and vice versa. In Section 1, we establish the model and derive a nonlinear dynamical system, which can characterize the evolutionary dynamics of stock price and investor structure. As it shows, the dynamical system involves a variety of parameters such as investor risk appetites, the level of bounded rationality, market liquidity, trading costs, dividend, fundamental value, and risk-free rate. Using the analysis of dynamical system, we study the impacts of these factors on asset pricing and volatility. In Section 2, we investigate the equilibrium of the dynamical system with mathematical analysis. In the case with rational and homogeneous investors, the equilibrium price equals to the intrinsic value which is determined by dividends. Furthermore, we solve the equilibrium in the case with bounded rational and heterogeneous investors. The equilibrium price is a weighted average of the estimated fundamental value and the intrinsic value. When the estimated fundamental value is equal to the intrinsic value, the equilibrium price is the same as the rational equilibrium price. We study the difference between the estimated fundamental value and the intrinsic value, and analyze its impacts on asset pricing and investor structure. The fraction of fundamentalists in the market is positively correlated with the absolute difference between the estimated fundamental value and the intrinsic value. Moreover, by using the Schur-Cohn criterion, we solve the stability conditions for the equilibrium. The stability conditions are determined by the parameters such as market liquidity, risk appetites and the deviation of the fundamental value from the intrinsic value. To guarantee the stability conditions, the difference between the estimated fundamental value and the intrinsic value should be neither too great nor too small. In Section 3, the simulation analysis is implemented. Under different parameter settings, we investigate the stability region, the bifurcation diagram and the phase portrait. When the stability conditions are not satisfied, the periodic and chaotic dynamics can be observed. The results of this study can explain the empirical findings of previous literatures. If the dividend policy is unstable, the volatility of dividend is great. Then, according to our study, investors would have less demand for stocks, and fundamentalists would take a small proportion in the market. This reflects institutional investors’ preference for dividend policy. In addition, if the dividend policy is unstable, the estimated fundamental value might deviate greatly from the intrinsic value, and the stability conditions cannot be satisfied. As a result, the price might fluctuate greatly. Then, the market might collapse. The findings provide some significant implications for understanding the complex phenomena in financial markets, making dividends policy and implementing market regulations. When companies formulate dividend policies, they should consider investors′ fundamental valuations of stocks, and should not make dividends too low or too high. In addition, market regulators can take measures to promote the disclosure of information, guide investors to have a reasonable valuation of stocks, so as to reduce market instability. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Chaos; Dividends; Dynamical system; Heterogenous beliefs; Stability","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85193751502"

Arbitrage Pricing Theory identifies the risk factors likely to impact crude oil returns. Subsequently, Quantile Regression estimates the relationship between the selected factors and the returns across different distribution quantiles. The West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude oil price is used in this study as a benchmark for crude oil prices. WTI’s price fluctuations can significantly impact the performance of global crude oil stocks and, subsequently, the global economy. Various statistical measures are used in this study to determine the proposed model's stability. The results show that changes in WTI returns can have varying effects depending on market conditions and levels of volatility. This study emphasizes the influence of structural discontinuities on returns. These are likely generated by changes in the global economy and the unpredictable demand for crude oil during the pandemic. The inclusion of pandemic, geopolitical, and inflation-related explanatory variables adds uniqueness to the study as it considers current global events that can affect crude oil returns. Findings show that the key factors that pose significant risks to returns are industrial production, inflation, the global price of energy, the shape of the yield curve, and global economic policy uncertainty. This implies that while making investment decisions in WTI futures, investors should pay particular attention to these elements. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Arbitrage pricing theory; crude oil; econometric model; quantile-regression; risk management; statistical methods","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85189629613"

Recent metrics, such as dynamic Initial Margin (IM) and Margin Value Adjustments (MVA) additionally require the simulation of future conditional sensitivities. For portfolios with non-linear instruments that do not admit closed-form valuation formulas, this poses a significant computational challenge. This problem is addressed by proposing a static replication algorithm for interest rate options with early-exercise features under an affine term-structure model. Under the appropriate conditions, we can find an equivalent portfolio of vanilla options that replicate these products. Specifically, we decompose the product into a portfolio of European swaptions. The weights and strikes of the portfolio are obtained by regressing the target option value with interpretable, feed-forward neural networks. Once an equivalent portfolio of European swaptions is determined, we can leverage on closed-form expressions to obtain the conditional prices and sensitivities, which serve as an input to exposure and SIMM-driven MVA quantification. For a consistent forward sensitivity estimation, this involves the differentiation of the portfolio-weights. The accuracy and convergence of the method is demonstrated through several representative numerical examples, benchmarked against the established least-square Monte Carlo method. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Affine term-structure modeling; Bermudan swaptions; Counterparty credit risk; CVA; Initial Margin; MVA; Static replication","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85185970359"

These enterprises have changed people′s lifestyles and have played an important role in promoting consumption and employment. However, the strong growth of the platform market comes with issues and scandals, including false or misleading information, poor quality, fake products, and counterfeits. The increasing number of such disputes has harmed the interests of consumers and has had a significant adverse social impact. Thus, how to achieve effective e-commerce platform supervision has become the focus of the government, practitioners, and researchers. E-commerce platform credit supervision requires collaboration and coordination between the government and e-commerce platforms. However, the collaborative regulation system is vulnerable and subject to various internal and external factors, such as interaction attributes, utility perception, and incentives. Resilience research explores whether changes in these factors lead to sudden changes in participants′ strategy selection, where resilience refers to the ability of the regulation system to maintain the current equilibrium state. Probing the mechanism of credit supervision resilience evolution can help capture the nonlinearity and randomness in the platform-government relationship from a quantitative perspective and provide decision support for developing credit supervision strategies. However, existing research on e-commerce platform credit supervision focuses on finding equilibrium strategies and their existence conditions, and “resilience” is rarely mentioned. In addition, existing resilience research is rarely based on a catastrophe perspective, and sudden changes in credit supervision are difficult to describe. Therefore, this study integrates resilience theory and stochastic catastrophe theory to propose a catastrophe-based resilience measure for the collaborative regulation system, investigate how system resilience is affected by how the system is regulated, and recommend preventive measures to effectively avoid unexpected radical changes. In the first part, the general framework and research context of the study are presented. In the second part, the catastrophe of supervision behavior is described using an evolutionary game and stochastic catastrophe theory. First, an evolutionary game model between the government and e-commerce platforms is proposed, and a payoff matrix is established. On this foundation, the Gaussian White noise is used to show the random disturbance in the game, and Itô stochastic differential equations are introduced to develop a stochastic dynamic system. Subsequently, a probability density function is introduced to build the stochastic cusp catastrophe model, and the catastrophe set is found to explain the catastrophe of the regulation system. In the third section, with the areas of catastrophes identified, the concept of credit regulation resilience is presented based on Holling′s definition of resilience, and a catastrophe-based resilience measure for the collaborative regulation system is proposed. In the fourth part, simulation experiments are conducted to explore the influence of excess return, punishment, the degree of collaboration between the government and e-commerce platforms, and the degree of public and media participation, and the effectiveness of the model is verified with practical cases. Finally, the advice on e-commerce platform credit supervision is presented in terms of results. Some important conclusions and managerial insights are derived. First, catastrophe occurs suddenly whenthe parameters cross the borderline of the catastrophe set. Therefore, controlling the relevant parameters away from the catastrophe set can maintain the effectiveness of the regulation system. Second, the resilience evolution process is consistent with the catastrophe process: the occurrence of catastrophe leads to rapid changes in resilience. Therefore, it is possible to predict the state of the regulation system based on resilience and intervene in time to control the occurrence of catastrophes when the value of resilience is found to change rapidly or be close to zero. Third, different parameters have different effects on resilience. Punishment has a significant impact on resilience, and the two share a “U”-shaped relationship. In addition, under the constraint of catastrophe threshold, resilience decreases with increasing excess returns and increases with increasing collaboration degree and public and media participation. Therefore, it would be more effective to combine resilience and catastrophe conditions to optimize the regulatory strategy. In general, this research integrates resilience theory and stochastic catastrophe theory to study e-commerce platform credit supervision issues, which provides new ideas for e-commerce platform credit supervision research. The study analyzes the impact of system parameter changes on catastrophe degree from a quantitative perspective through resilience measurement, and the conclusion can provide a basis for e-commerce platform supervision warnings and policy optimization. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Credit supervision; E-commerce platform; Resilience; Stochastic catastrophe theory","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85185965736"

Empirical asset pricing is a challenging task in financial analysis, which has attracted research attention. However, existing studies only focus on tackling the challenges of equity risk premium in the single stock market. Considering multiple economic linkages between the two countries, the transaction history of the US stock market as empirical knowledge is a powerful supplement to improve the prediction of equity risk premium in the China market. In this paper, we aim to fully leverage the prior information in two stock markets for empirical asset pricing models. Due to the rich financial domain knowledge, there may be various characteristic signals that partially overlap in different periods. To address these issues, we propose a framework based on long-short dual-mode knowledge distillation, termed as LSDM-KD, which incorporates US and China stock market models, and a shared characteristic signals model. The method effectively understands the relationships between assets and market behaviour, reducing reliance on expensive correlation databases and professional knowledge. Extensive experiments conducted on US and China stock market datasets demonstrate that our LSDM-KD can significantly improve the performance of empirical asset pricing. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","empirical asset pricing; Financial networks; knowledge distillation; representation learning","Commerce; Costs; Distillation; Domain Knowledge; E-learning; Asset pricing; Asset pricing model; Characteristic signal; China's Stock Markets; Dual modes; Empirical asset pricing; Equity risk premiums; Financial networks; Knowledge distillation; Representation learning; Financial markets","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85183078981"

The proposed method employs a hybrid approach, integrating a 1-dimensional convolutional neural network (1DCNN), long-short term memory (LSTM), and XGBoost algorithms. The 1DCNN is used to learn local and short-term patterns, while LSTM is employed to capture both short and long-term dependencies. Furthermore, we have implemented an algorithm that utilizes hull moving average (HMA) and simple moving average (SMA) crossover data to detect trading entry points and major trends in the market. The combination of the SMA–HMA crossover algorithm and predictions provided by the 1DCNN-BiLSTM-XGBoost algorithm yields exceptional results in terms of prediction accuracy and profitability. Additionally, these integrated techniques effectively filter out noise and mitigate false breakouts, which are often observed with US 30-year Treasury bonds. In the field of financial time series prediction, the effectiveness of 1DCNN and LSTM in identifying trading entry points and market perturbations has not been comprehensively studied. Therefore, our work fills this gap by demonstrating through experiments that the proposed 1DCNN-BiLSTM-XGBoost algorithm, in combination with moving average crossovers, effectively reduces noise and market perturbations. This leads to the precise identification of trading entry points and accurate recognition of trend signals for US 30-year Treasury bonds. We demonstrate through experiments that our proposed approach achieves an average root mean squared error of 0.0001 and an R-square value of 0.9999, highlighting its promise as a method for predicting market trends and trading entry points for US 30-year Treasury bonds. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","1-dimensional convolutional neural network (1DCNN); long-short term memory (LSTM); signal trend prediction; time series forecasting","Brain; Commerce; Convolution; Convolutional neural networks; Forecasting; Mean square error; Time series; 1-dimensional convolutional neural network; Convolutional neural network; Entry point; Long-short term memory; Market trends; Moving averages; Signal trend prediction; Time series forecasting; Treasury bonds; Trend prediction; Long short-term memory","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85173000047"

Exposure reflects the attention paid by market participants in earnings calls to a firm's climate-related risks and opportunities. When extracted from realized returns, the unconditional risk premium is insignificant but exhibits a period with a positive risk premium before the financial crisis and a steady increase thereafter. Forward-looking expected return proxies deliver an unconditionally positive risk premium with maximum values of 0.5%-1% p.a., depending on the proxy, between 2011 and 2014. The risk premium has been lower since 2015, especially when the expected return proxy explicitly accounts for the higher opportunities and lower crash risks that characterize high-exposure stocks. This finding arises as the priced part of the risk premium primarily originates from uncertainty about climate-related upside opportunities.

Prior research has established the effectiveness of machine learning in forecasting stock market trends, irrespective of the analytical approach employed, be it technical, fundamental, or sentiment analysis. In the context of fiscal year-end selection, the decision may initially seem straightforward, with December 31 being the apparent choice, as discussed by B. Kamp in 2002. The primary argument for a uniform fiscal year-end centers around comparability. When assessing the financial performance of two firms with differing fiscal year-ends, substantial shifts in the business environment during non-overlapping periods can impede meaningful comparisons. Moreover, when two firms merge, the need to synchronize their annual reporting often results in shorter or longer fiscal years, complicating time series analysis. In the US S&P stock market, misaligned fiscal years lead to variations in report publication dates across different industries and market segments. Since the financial reporting dates of US S&P companies are determined independently by each listed entity, relying solely on these dates for investment decisions may prove less than entirely reliable and impact the accuracy of return prediction models. Hence, our interest lies in the synchronized fiscal year of the TW stock market, leveraging machine learning models for fundamental analysis to forecast returns. We employed four machine learning models: Random Forest (RF), Feedforward Neural Network (FNN), Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU), and Financial Graph Attention Network (FinGAT). We crafted portfolios by selecting stocks with higher predicted returns using these machine learning models. These portfolios outperformed the TW50 index benchmarks in the Taiwan stock market, demonstrating superior returns and portfolio scores. Our study’s findings underscore the advantages of using aligned financial ratios for predicting the top 20 high-return stocks in a mid-to-long-term investment context, delivering over 50% excess returns across the four models while maintaining lower risk profiles. Using the top 10 high-return stocks produced over 100% relative returns with an acceptable level of risk, highlighting the effectiveness of employing machine learning techniques based on financial ratios for stock prediction. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","artificial intelligence models; feedforward neural network; financial graph attention network; financial ratios; fundamental analysis; gate recurrent unit; machine learning; random forest; time series prediction","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85178896764"

BTC perpetual futures are derivative contracts, which depend upon the underlying BTC SPOT (current) price. Pricing perpetual futures fairly is hard, using traditional arbitrage arguments, because of the volatile nature of the so called funding rate, which is used as the replacement of risk free rate in the Cryptocurrency market. This work presents a novel technique for pricing BTC futures contracts using conditional volatility and mean models. Intra-day high-frequency futures' return volatility and mean are modelled using different ML and econometric techniques. A comparison is made using statistical measures to find the model that best captures the intra-day conditional mean and volatility. Exponential generalized autoregressive conditional heteroskedasticity is shown to be an almost unbiased predictor of intra-day volatility, while a constant autoregressive moving average (0, 0) model best captures the conditional mean of the returns. A market directional high frequency trading algorithm is developed using the volatility and mean models. The algorithm first prices the futures contract at some future point of time using the volatility and mean regression models. Next, the slope between the current futures price and the expected price are used to predict the market direction. A long or short position is taken depending upon the expected market direction movement. Extensive back-testing results show absolute returns of 1500%–8000% depending upon the transaction fees and leverage used.

Owing to the vast applications of the structured surface in many industrial sectors, considerable attention has been paid by many scholars to improve the surface performance aspects by studying their solid–liquid interface characterizations. In the current study, a new technique is introduced to manufacture a functional surface with water repellency feature through grinding process. Based on the solid–liquid interface evaluations of the modified surface, by structuring the surface, the contact angle increases from 35° (untreated surface) to 127° for structured surface. Therefore, the reinforced surface showed hydrophobicity with a 263% improvement for a scratch area fraction more than 75%. Formation of air pads trapped in the vacant space of the scratches was the main cause to enhance contact angle for structured surface. Since air molecules have very low inclination to chemical bonding with water molecules, the water droplet did not penetrate the scratches space and contact angle enhanced. A new analytical model for predicting the solid–liquid surface property was simultaneously developed by interaction of the kinematics of the grinding technique with single diamond and the basic wettability theory of the Cassie-Baxter. Therefore, the effect of all input parameters on the output results was studied in terms of achieving the best solid–liquid interaction performance through expanded model. The optimal values were calculated and the proposed structured surface was manufactured during the grinding process. According to the value of the static contact angle measured during experimental tests (127°) and its analytical value (123°), less than 4% error was observed between the results, which showed the high accuracy of the equation expanded on the present work. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Grinding process; Hydrophobicity; Solid-liquid interface; Static contact angle; Structured surface","Chemical bonds; Grinding (machining); Hydrophobicity; Molecules; Phase interfaces; Surface structure; Tribology; Experimental assessment; Grinding process; Industrial sector; Multiple strategy; Risk free; Solid-liquid interfaces; Static contact angle; Structured surfaces; Surface performance; Tribological properties; Contact angle","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85170069308"

This study evaluated the economic feasibility and estimated the risk premium of 12 rainfed soybean production systems with various planting densities, fertilization rates and planting patterns by considering the impact of soybean price fluctuation. There were two planting densities (D<inf>1</inf>: 160,000 plants ha−1 and D<inf>2</inf>: 320,000 plants ha−1), two fertilization rates (F<inf>1</inf>: 20 kg ha−1 N, 30 kg ha−1 P, 30 kg ha−1 K; F<inf>2</inf>: 40 kg ha−1 N, 60 kg ha−1 P, 60 kg ha−1 K) and three planting patterns (F+W<inf>0</inf>: flat cultivation with no irrigation; R+W<inf>0</inf>: plastic-mulched ridge-furrow cultivation (PMRF) with no irrigation; R+W<inf>1</inf>: PMRF with supplemental irrigation of 30 mm at the pod-filling stage). Based on the two-year (2019–2020) field data in a semi-humid drought-prone region of northwest China and soybean price fluctuation from January 2014 to June 2021, the net income (NI) was calculated by considering the impact of soybean price fluctuation and assuming constant soybean production costs. The net present value (NPV) method and the stochastic efficiency with respect to a function (SERF) method were used to evaluate the profitability of protective alternatives and the risk of these alternatives. The results showed that the 12 proposed soybean production systems were economically feasible. Reducing the fertilization rate reduced the input costs, but it did not necessarily result in a decrease in soybean yield and NI. The payback period of all production systems was within two years for farmers investing through loans. High-fertilizer and high-density production systems made personal investment obtain the highest economic benefit in this study, which was not the best investment strategy from the perspective of production-to-investment ratio and environmental protection departments. The preferences of farmers with various risk aversion and environmental protection departments in terms of risk premium were also proposed. The economic and risk assessment framework of this study can enhance the understanding of the adjustment of production systems from different perspectives, and provide strategies for promoting the protection of economic, environmental and socially sustainable agricultural systems. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","economic evaluation; output/input ratio; price fluctuation; risk premium; soybean","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85178361938"

NFT coins are cryptocurrencies that facilitate NFT ecosystems by supporting NFT trading and platform governance. Accurate price predictions of NFT coins are crucial for risk managing volatility and constructing optimal portfolios. This study employs machine learning techniques to predict the daily price direction of four key NFT coins, namely ENJ, MANA, THETA, and XTZ. The machine learning methods employed include three decision tree-based methods (random forests, extremely randomized trees, XGBoost), support vector machine, Lasso and Naïve Bayes. The findings show that random forests, extremely randomized trees, XGBoost, and support vector machine models have accuracy ranging between 80% and 90% for predictions in the 14 to 21 day range. This adds to the literature showing that machine learning methods have high prediction accuracy for cryptocurrency prices. Conversely, Lasso or Naïve Bayes models yield considerably lower prediction accuracy. Feature importance is assessed using Shapley values. The Shapley value feature importance calculated from random forests highlights that, for 14 and 21-day forecasts, four variables - five-year expected inflation, ten-year bond yields, the interest rate spread, and on balance volume - are consistently highly ranked across all NFT coins. Additionally, the MA50, MA200, and WAD also emerge as important features. These results highlight the importance of including macroeconomic variables which capture business cycle conditions and technical analysis indicators that capture investor psychology as features. NFT coin portfolios constructed using trading signals generated from Extra Trees outperforms a buy and hold portfolio. Extra Trees are easy and fast to implement and investors not making use of this information are likely making sub-optimal investment decisions. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Forecasting NFT coin prices; Machine learning; Portfolio analysis; Random forests; Technical indicators","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85174468022"

In contrast to dynamic replication, which needs to be continuously updated as the market moves, a semi-static replication needs to be rebalanced on just a finite number of instances. We show that the exotic derivative can be decomposed into a portfolio of vanilla discount bond options, which mirrors its value as the market moves and can be priced in closed form. This paves the way toward the efficient numerical simulation of xVA, market, and credit risk metrics for which forward valuation is the key ingredient. The static portfolio composition is obtained by regressing the target option’s value using an interpretable, artificial neural network. Leveraging the universal approximation power of neural networks, we prove that the replication error can be arbitrarily small for a sufficiently large portfolio. A direct, a lower bound, and an upper bound estimator for the Bermudan swaption price are inferred from the replication algorithm. Additionally, closed-form error margins to the price statistics are determined. We practically study the accuracy and convergence of the method through several numerical experiments. The results indicate that the semi-static replication approaches the LSM benchmark with basis point accuracy and provides tight, efficient error bounds.

To enhance the accuracy of the model, calibration was performed employing a supervised machine learning algorithm, a continuous risk-free curve, and a dynamic implied volatility surface, derived from the current market data of vanilla options on S&P 500 futures. The amalgamation of these models yields instantaneous pricing for exotic option derivatives, contingent on the investor's determination of time to maturity and barrier levels. The efficacy of the model was evaluated by comparing the output prices to theoretical model predictions and a selection of over-the-counter traded options. Our findings indicate that the proposed dynamic, integrated approach substantially reduces the disparity between the theoretical models and current market prices. The prices calculated by our model demonstrate a marginal error of merely 0.33% in comparison to market prices, a significant improvement over the considerably larger error of 3.12% exhibited by traditional models. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","artificial intelligence; calibration; exotic options; Heston model; implied volatility; Monte Carlo simulation; strike price; vanilla options","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Bronze Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85175234385"

Despite this, there has been relatively little research, making it a good candidate for the use of data mining techniques. In this paper, a novel approach designed to predict the vote results of the Korean Monetary Policy Committee regarding the base interest rate was proposed. To predict sentence sentiment, prior monetary policy decision text was used as input for classification models. The sentence sentiment prediction model showed 83.7% performance when using a support vector machine. In addition, it was observed that the bigrams extracted from documents provided important descriptions of the Korean economy at the time. Finally, the document sentiment of monetary policy decision was calculated using aggregating sentence sentiment, and the vote results were predicted using this sentiment. As a result, when using the support vector machine to predict the Monetary Policy Committee vote results, the performance improved by 29.5% over the baseline model. Statistical tests confirmed whether there is a difference in document sentiments between unanimous and non-unanimous, and the null hypothesis was rejected at a significance level of 5%. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Data mining; Monetary policy committee's vote result prediction; Monetary policy decision; South Korea government bond; Text mining","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85173828901"

Lagged values of these features up to 10 previous days are also used. Four machine learning models are used: Random Forest, Gradient Boosted Regression Trees (GBRT), and Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), to forecast future gold prices. The study finds that the most influential stocks indices for prediction are one-day lagged data of ASX, S&P500, TA35, IBEX, and AEX, as well as U.S. and Japan bonds yields and delayed data of gas and silver. Furthermore, the study's models identify that one-day lagged VIX score and our VIX dummy variable have a significant impact on gold price, indicating that economic uncertainty affects gold prices. The results suggest that incorporating various financial indicators and moving averages can be a powerful tool for predicting future gold prices.

The study investigates the underlying parameters defining the project-specific risk premium attached to an offshore wind project. These parameters are modelled as stochastic variables, and a probabilistic financial analysis is conducted using Monte Carlo Simulation. To calculate an interest rate based on operational characteristics, the present study assumes that two net present value equations yielding the same result can be written where certainty equivalent cash flows discounted at the risk-free rate and b) expected cash flows discounted at the cost of capital. The project-related risk is then estimated by solving the resulting equation for the unknown cost of capital. The macroeconomic factors are also considered as they impact the uncertainty associated with revenue and operating expenditure. The model developed to calculate the cost of capital is validated by comparing it with the data obtained for publicly traded renewable energy companies worldwide. Finally, the developed model is demonstrated for a fictitious ageing offshore wind farm under different economic circumstances.

The relationship between credit spread and physical climate risk is significant and slightly positive, yet the coefficient indicates no meaningful spread penalty for increased physical climate risk. We also find that racial composition (the percent of a community that is Black) explains a statistically significant and meaningful portion of municipal credit spreads, even after controlling for a variety of variables in domains such as geographic location of issuer, bond structure (e.g., bond maturity), credit rating, and non-race economic variables (e.g., per capita income). Assuming 4 trillion USD in annual outstanding par across the entire municipal market, and weighting each issuer by its percent Black, an estimated 19 basis point (bp) penalty for Black Americans sums to approximately 900 million USD annually in aggregate.

This study aims to address these anomalies in the Chinese market by employing machine learning techniques to measure systematic risk. A large dataset consisting of 770 variables, encompassing macroeconomic, micro-firm, and cross-effect factors, was constructed to develop a machine learning-based dynamic capital asset pricing model. Additionally, we investigated the differences in factors influencing time-varying beta between state-owned enterprises (SOEs) and non-SOEs, providing economic explanations for the black-box issues. Our findings demonstrated the effectiveness of random forest and neural networks, with the four-layer neural network performing best and leading to a substantial rise in the excess return of the long–short portfolio, up to 0.36%. Notably, liquidity indicators emerged as the primary drivers influencing beta, followed by momentum. Moreover, our analysis revealed a shift in variable importance during the transition from SOEs to non-SOEs, as liquidity and momentum gradually replaced fundamentals and valuation as key determinants. This research contributes to both theoretical and practical domains by bridging the research gap in incorporating machine learning methods into asset pricing research. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","asset pricing; beta estimation; machine learning; stock market","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85166206513"

Using a large dataset of US mid-cap companies observed over 30 years, we look to predict the default probability term structure over the short to medium term and understand which data sources (i.e. fundamental, market or pricing data) contribute most to the default risk. Whereas existing methods typically require that data from different time periods are first aggregated and turned into cross-sectional features, we frame the problem as a multi-label panel data classification problem. To tackle it, we then employ transformer models, a state-of-the-art deep learning model emanating from the natural language processing domain. To make this approach suitable to the given credit risk setting, we use a loss function for multi-label classification, to deal with the term structure, and propose a multi-channel architecture with differential training that allows the model to use all input data efficiently. Our results show that the proposed deep learning architecture produces superior performance, resulting in a sizeable improvement in AUC (Area Under the receiver operating characteristic Curve) over traditional models.

They model spatio-temporal momentum with neural networks of varying complexities and demonstrate that a simple neural network with only a single fully connected layer learns to simultaneously generate trading signals for all assets in a portfolio by incorporating both their time-series and cross-sectional momentum features. Back testing on portfolios of 46 actively traded US equities and 12 equity index futures contracts, they demonstrate that the model is able to retain its performance over benchmarks in the presence of high transaction costs of up to 5–10 basis points.

Using half-hourly data from 2011 to 2015 for New South Wales and Queensland, it is shown that the official half-hourly demand forecasts do not satisfy the econometric properties required of rational forecasts. Instead there is a relationship between forecasts and forecast horizon similar to a term structure model of interest rates. To study the term structure of demand forecasts, a factor analysis that uses a small set of latent factors to explain the common variation among multiple observables is imple-mented. A three-factor model is identified with the factors admitting interpretation as the level, slope and curvature of the term structure of forecasts. The validity of the model is reinforced by assessing the economic value of demand forecasts.

The wealth of data on people’s self-reported satisfaction with life in a wide variety of circumstances, from around the world, including respondents undergoing a diversity of changes and life events and subject to a variety of public policies and policy changes, has provided a rich base of knowledge about what makes life good. This growing research literature has in recent years been met with interest from central governments looking for accountable but more human-centred approaches to measuring progress, as well as for communicating objectives, making policy, and allocating resources. Meanwhile, frameworks for benefit-cost accounting using inference from life satisfaction data have been devised. In some cases central government finance departments and treasuries are incorporating this approach into their formal methodology for budgeting. The body of causal inference about these effects is still somewhat diffuse.

Compared to property price determinants, the capitalisation rate has received significantly less attention. This is somewhat surprising given that the capitalisation rate is a more insightful indicator for investors on commercial property market performance than merely price changes or trends. The capitalisation rate, measured as the ratio of net operating income to the property’s capital value, captures the asset’s overall ability to generate income which is crucial for investors who typically invest in property for their income-generating capacity. The purpose of this paper is to address these issues. Design/methodology/approach: To evaluate the determinants of capitalisation rates, time series analysis was used. The data capture performance in the Australian commercial property market between 2005 and 2018. All macroeconomic and financial data are freely available from official sources such as the Australian Bureau of Statistics and the nation’s central bank. Methodology wise, given the problematic nature of the data such as a mixed order of integration and the possibility of cointegration amongst some of the I (1) variables, the autoregressive distributed lag model was selected given its flexibility and relative lack of assumptions. Findings: Bond rates, market risk premiums, stock market excess returns and other macroeconomic variables were found to drive capitalisation rates of Australian commercial properties. A 1% increase in the bond rate results in approximately 0.3–2.4% increase in capitalisation rates depending on the sub-market. Further, a 1% increase in excess market returns results in a 0.01–0.02% increase in capitalisation rates. Regarding risk premiums, a 100 basis point increase in the BBB spread results in approximately 0.92–1.27% reduction in cap rates in certain markets. Practical implications: Asset managers will find these results useful in asset allocation strategies. Commercial properties offer attractive investment qualities such as yield stability in periods of economic uncertainty while allowing for the possibility of capital growth through appreciation of the underlying asset. By understanding the factors that affect the capitalisation rate, practitioners may predict emerging trends and identify threats to portfolio return and stability. This allows better integration of commercial property in the construction of portfolios that remain robust in a variety of market conditions. Originality/value: The contribution to literature is significant given the lack of similar studies in the Australian market. The performance of real estate assets using cap rates as a comparative measure to equities and bonds influences decisions in asset allocation strategies. It provides crucial information for investors to estimate the performance of commercial property. This research supports the notion that both space and capital market indicators jointly affect capitalisation rates. The findings expand the knowledge base relating to commercial properties and validate the assessments of investors, developers and valuers who utilise yield as a performance benchmark for asset allocation strategies. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","ARDL; Australia; Capitalisation rate; Commercial real estate; Time series analysis","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85146597624"

This new macro factor, termed the SAGLasso factor, is a linear combination of merely 30 selected macro variables out of 917. Furthermore, it can be decomposed into three sublevel factors: a novel housing factor, an employment factor, and an inflation factor. Importantly, the predictive power of the SAGLasso factor is robust to bond yields, namely, the SAGLasso factor is not spanned by bond yields. Moreover, we show that the unspanned variation of the SAGLasso factor cannot be attributed to yield measurement error or macro measurement error. The SAGLasso factor therefore provides a potential resolution to the spanning controversy in the macro-finance literature. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","group lasso; machine learning; macro-based return predictors; macro-finance term-structure models; spanning controversy","Learning algorithms; Machine learning; Measurement errors; Government bonds; Group lassos; Linear combinations; Machine learning algorithms; Machine-learning; Macro-based return predictor; Macro-finance term-structure model; Predictive power; Spanning controversy; Term-structure models; Finance","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85150057844"

The two regimes, a high-spread and a low-spread regime, are distinguished by using a threshold, in accordance with the perceived ""fair""value of the spread as a reference point. Our results suggest that government-bond spreads are regime-dependent, as most of the regression coefficients of the determinants of the spread are larger (in absolute value) in the high-spread regime than in the low-spread regime. That is, an improvement in the macroeconomic environment (e.g., lower unemployment, lower inflation, lower growth of the debt-to-GDP ratio, less macroeconomic uncertainty, higher growth of real GDP), and/or an improvement in the quality of institutions (e.g., less corruption) reduce the spread facing a country (by enhancing its creditworthiness) to a greater extent in high-spread situations than in low-spread situations.

The agent has access to a risk-free asset and a stock in a financial market. But she does not observe perfectly the expected return rate of the stock so she has to estimate this key parameter before making decisions. Besides the general observable financial information, the agent can also acquire a news signal process whose accuracy depends on the agent’s attention. We assume that the agent pays limited attention on the signal and she does not trust her estimation model. So it is necessary to consider model ambiguity in this paper as well. The agent maximizes the expected utility of her terminal wealth under the worst-case scenario. Under this setting, we derive the robust optimal strategy explicitly. In the presence of the attention and ambiguity aversion, the myopic term of the strategy, the hedging term of the strategy and the worst-case scenario are all changed. We find that more attention makes the variance of the estimated return smaller. The numerical examples also show that a more attentive agent has a better estimation of the unobservable parameter and is more confident on her estimation. Consequently, the worst-case scenario deviates less from the reference model, which implies a higher expected return rate under the worst-case scenario, thus invests more in the stock © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","CRRA utility; HJB equation; limited attention; portfolio choice; robust strategy","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85159911737"

Investor attention on the COVID-19 pandemic is likely to play an important role in this response. Focusing on the Bitcoin futures market, this paper aims to investigate whether pandemic attention can explain and forecast the returns and volatility of Bitcoin futures. Using the daily Google search volume index for the “coronavirus” keyword from January 2020 to February 2022 to represent pandemic attention, this paper implements the Granger causality test, Vector Autoregression (VAR) analysis, and several linear effects analyses. The findings suggest that pandemic attention is a granger cause of Bitcoin returns and volatility. It appears that an increase in pandemic attention results in lower returns and excessive volatility in the Bitcoin futures market, even after taking into account the interactive effects and the influence of controlling other financial markets. In addition, this paper carries out the out-of-sample forecasts and finds that the predictive models with pandemic attention do improve the out-of-sample forecast performance, which is enhanced in the prediction of Bitcoin returns while diminished in the prediction of Bitcoin volatility as the forecast horizon is extended. Finally, the predictive models including pandemic attention can generate significant economic benefits by constructing portfolios among Bitcoin futures and risk-free assets. All the results demonstrate that pandemic attention plays an important and non-negligible role in the Bitcoin futures market.

This study aimed to build the uncertainty index and control it in the regression analysis model to solve the limitations above. The empirical analysis in Ho Chi Minh Stock Exchange (HOSE) showed that a value premium exists, and value stocks have a higher average return than growth stocks due to the higher overall risk. Furthermore, this study combined the Support Vector Regression (SVR) algorithm with the risk premium theoretical framework for the forecasting model; consequently, it is the most efficient model. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","book value; risk premium; SVR; uncertainty; Value premium","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85150507268"

Forecasting the daily demand can improve the local service provider’s access to information and help them manage their short-term supply more effectively. This study developed the forecasting model using real-time data and weather information from Jeju Island, South Korea. Cluster analysis under the rental pattern of the electric kickboard is a component of the forecasting processes. We cannot achieve noticeable results at first because of the low amount of training data. We require a lot of data to produce a solid prediction result. For the sake of the subsequent experimental procedure, we created synthetic time-series data using a generative adversarial networks (GAN) approach and combined the synthetic data with the original data. The outcomes have shown how the GAN-based synthetic data generation approach has the potential to enhance prediction accuracy. We employ an ensemble model to improve prediction results that cannot be achieved using a single regressor model. It is a weighted combination of several base regression models to one meta-regressor. To anticipate the daily demand in this study, we create an ensemble model by merging three separate base machine learning algorithms, namely CatBoost, Random Forest (RF), and Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost). The effectiveness of the suggested strategies was assessed using some evaluation indicators. The forecasting outcomes demonstrate that mixing synthetic data with original data improves the robustness of daily demand forecasting and outperforms other models by generating more agreeable values for suggested assessment measures. The outcomes further show that applying ensemble techniques can reasonably increase the forecasting model’s accuracy for daily electric kickboard demand. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","deep learning; demand prediction; electric vehicles; ensemble method; generative adversarial networks; machine learning; regression","Adaptive boosting; Cluster analysis; Deep learning; Electric vehicles; Generative adversarial networks; Learning systems; Regression analysis; Demand prediction; Ensemble methods; Ensemble models; Forecasting models; Machine-learning; Prediction accuracy; Regression; Synthetic data; Synthetic data generations; Forecasting; algorithm; forecasting; random forest; weather; Algorithms; Neural Networks, Computer; Random Forest; Weather","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85146723550"

In this paper, a new decomposition integration model (VADM) is proposed to predict coal prices by combining the variational modal decomposition (VMD), arithmetic optimization algorithm (AOA), deep temporal convolutional network (DeepTCN), and mean impact value algorithm (MIV). Firstly, the AOA optimization algorithm is used to improve the VMD, AOA-VMD was obtained. It is used to decompose the steam coal price series. Then, the decomposed subsequences are predicted for the prediction of steam coal prices by using DeepTCN. Finally, the MIV algorithm is applied to analyze the impact of different factors on the price of steam coal. It is found that: the steam coal price sub-series decomposed by AOA-VMD are smoother and more linear compared with the original series; the errors in forecasting steam coal prices are significantly reduced after considering newly proposed factors, interest rates, such as the overnight Shanghai interbank offered rate and the six-month treasury bond yield; the MAPE, MASE and SMAPE of the VADM model all show different degrees of decline compared with benchmark models. The forecasting effect of VADM model is better than the benchmark model in terms of stability and accuracy, and can be used for short-term forecasting of coal prices. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Arithmetic optimization algorithm; Deep temporal convolutional network; Mean impact value algorithm; Steam coal price forecasting; Variational modal decomposition","Commerce; Convolution; Costs; Forecasting; Optimization; Steam; Arithmetic optimization algorithm; Convolutional networks; Deep temporal convolutional network; Impact value; Mean impact value algorithm; Modal decomposition; Optimization algorithms; Price forecasting; Steam coal; Steam coal price forecasting; Variational modal decomposition; Coal; algorithm; artificial neural network; coal supply; decomposition analysis; forecasting method; numerical model; optimization; price determination","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85145655492"

The method is designed for continuous repetitive use and is consistent with work by Diebold and Li, providing reasonable extrapolated rates, with an appropriate level of volatility over time. The Svensson model is adopted, and its parameters are estimated by the combination of a genetic algorithm and a quasi-Newton nonlinear optimization method. We innovate with a new objective function that focuses on both parts of the estimated curves (interpolated and extrapolated). For this purpose, a stability component is added. The new objective function aims to solve the problem of estimating long-term rates not observable in the market, for which the estimates are usually artificially stable or excessively volatile. The results show that the estimation method is able to bring the volatility of extrapolated rates to levels consistent with those observed for the longest liquid rate. Estimation errors are small enough and there is no statistical evidence that they are biased. The method is useful for the insurance market, since it provides interest rates that do not lead to artificially stable or excessively volatile technical provisions. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85138326527"

This framework has a closed-form expression for IRP. Since inflation yields are not observed, to estimate the model parameters I approximate them by the break-even inflation rate. This approximation works well because the convexity correction is very small. I find that the estimated IRP is strongly correlated with those obtained using surveys or more complex models. Therefore, I provide an easier procedure to obtain IRP, avoiding the cumbersome estimation process of high-order models. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","affine models; break-even inflation rate; inflation forecasting; Inflation risk premium","capital flow; capital provision; forecasting method; Gaussian method; inflation; real exchange rate","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85136485968"

Individuals who herd do not outperform either market or non-herd portfolios, suggesting that herding is a behavioral bias. Thus, such behavior seems to destabilize stock markets, creating temporary discrepancies in stock prices followed by reversals back to fundamentals.

The incremented medical waste amidst the pandemic exposes the improper waste management system of various developing countries. India, being one of the prominent developing countries, produces the largest waste in the world. Nonetheless, the Indian waste management system is not able to manage the massive amount of waste generated. Henceforth, this research study approaches to reveal the prominent factors which are causing failure in the system of medical waste management in India. This manuscript mainly focuses on two aspects. Firstly, this paper illuminates the factors which are hindering medical waste management by third-party logistics (3PL). Secondly, this study discusses a unique interval-value intuitionistic fuzzy set (IVIFS) based on Decision Making Trial and Evaluation Laboratory (DEMATEL) to depict graphical causal interrelationships among the factors. In addition, the analytic network process (ANP) is utilized to estimate the influence ranking of each factor. The results of this research anticipate that the transportation and disposal-related constraining factors require more attention from 3PL managers. The current study is unique as it enriches the various hindering factors on 3PL BMW management by discussing the ranking and relationship among factors. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","ANP; Bio-medical waste (BMW); DEMATEL; IVIFS; Third-party Logistics","Developing countries; Fuzzy sets; Outsourcing; Waste management; Bio-medical; Bio-medical waste; Decision making trial and evaluation laboratory; Decisions makings; Interval value; Interval-value intuitionistic fuzzy set; Intuitionistic fuzzy sets; Medical waste management; Medical wastes; Third-party logistics; Decision making","Article","Final","All Open Access; Bronze Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85131091442"

Using the local projection method (Jordà 2004, 2005, 2009), we forecast the dynamic responses of the betas of hedge fund strategies to macroeconomic and financial shocks—especially volatility and illiquidity shocks—over the subprime crisis in order to investigate their market timing activities. In a robustness check, using TVAR (Balke 2000), we simulate the reaction of hedge fund strategies’ betas in extreme scenarios allowing moderate and strong adverse shocks. Our results show that the behavior of hedge fund strategies regarding the monitoring of systematic risk is highly nonlinear in extreme scenarios—especially during the subprime crisis. We find that countercyclical strategies have an investment technology which differs from procyclical ones. During crises, the former seek to capture non-traditional risk premia by deliberately increasing their systematic risk while the later focus more on minimizing risk. Our results suggest that the hedge fund strategies’ betas respond more to illiquidity uncertainty than to illiquidity risk during crises. We find that illiquidity and VIX shocks are the major drivers of systemic risk in the hedge fund industry. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Hedge fund; Illiquidity risk shock; Illiquidity uncertainty shock; Local projection model; Measurement errors; Optimal forecast; Procyclicality; TVAR","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85126242004"

The advantage of using this approach is that it allows for a nonlinear relationship between these variables depending on the level of consumption. We estimate the coefficients using a Phillips-Hansen type fully modified quantile estimator to correct for the presence of endogeneity in the cointegrating relationship. To test for the null of cointegration at each quantile, we apply a quantile CUSUM test. Results show that: (i) consumption is more sensitive to changes in labor income than to changes in asset wealth for the entire distribution of consumption, (ii) the elasticity of consumption with respect to labor income (asset wealth) is larger at the right (left) tail of the consumption distribution than at the left (right) tail, (iii) the series are cointegrated around the median, but not in the tails of the distribution of consumption, (iv) using the estimated cay obtained for the right (left) tail of the distribution of consumption improves the long-run (short-run) forecast ability on real excess stock returns over a risk-free rate. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","asset return forecasting; cay; quantile cointegration; quantile regression; stationarity","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85115652854"

Design/methodology/approach: To extract the latent factors (level, slope and curvature) of the Turkish sovereign yield curve, we estimate conventional Nelson and Siegel (1987) model with nonlinear least squares. Then, we decompose oil price shocks into supply, demand and risk shocks using structural VAR (structural VAR) models. After this separation, we apply Engle (2002) dynamic conditional correlation GARCH (DCC-GARCH (1,1)) method to investigate time-varying co-movements between yield curve factors and oil price shocks. Finally, using the LP (local projections) proposed by Jorda (2005), we estimate the impulse-response functions to examine the impact of different oil price shocks on yield curve factors. Findings: Our results demonstrate that the various oil price shocks influence the yield curve factors quite differently. A supply shock leads to a statistically significant increase in the level factor. This result shows that elevated oil prices due to supply disruptions are interpreted as a signal of a surge in inflation expectations since the cost channel prevails. Besides, unanticipated demand shocks have a positive impact on the slope factor as a result of the central bank policy response for offsetting the elevated inflation expectations. Finally, a risk shock is associated with a decrease in the curvature factor indicating that risk shocks influence the medium-term bonds due to the deflationary pressure resulting from depressed economic conditions. Practical implications: Our results provide new insights to understand the driving forces of yield curve movements induced by various oil shocks to formulate appropriate policy responses. Originality/value: The study contributes to the literature by two main dimensions. First, the recent oil shock identification scheme of Ready (2018) is modified using the “geopolitical oil price risk index” to capture the changes in the risk perceptions of oil markets driven by geopolitical tensions such as terrorism and conflicts and sanctions. The modified identification scheme attributes more power to demand shocks in explaining the variation of the oil price compared to that of the baseline scheme. Second, it provides recent evidence that distinguishes the impact of oil demand and supply shocks on Turkey's yield curve. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Emerging markets; Geopolitical oil price risks; Local projections; Oil price; Supply and demand shocks; Yield curve factors","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85100977846"

We developed a macromarketing framework to provide a linkage between the consumers, producers, and societal impacts of GE corn. An empirical Arbitrage Pricing Model (APT) was used to quantify risks and risk premiums associated with GE corn production. The risk premium deduced from the APT model provides a measure of intrinsic compensation for taking on higher or lower risks by participants in the marketing system. An Auto-Regressive Distributed Lag (ARDL) regression estimation of the APT model reveals that GE causes corn prices to go down due to increase supply, but significantly reduced the risk premium for producing corn in the United States.

The objective functions are the expected portfolio wealth and the expected Variance and Conditional Value at Risk as the portfolio risk measures.

The purpose of this study is to reconsider the out-of-sample forecasting performance of structural time series processes relative to that of a random walk with or without drift. Design/methodology/approach: This study uses bivariate vector autoregression and Markov switching representations to generate out-of-sample forecasts of ten-year sovereign bond yields, when the information set is augmented by including the growth rate of the monetary base, and the estimation relies on monthly data from countries that have pursued unconventional policies over the last decade. Findings: The results show that naive forecasts are not better than those of structural time series models, based on root mean squared errors, while the Markov model provides additional information on price reversals, through probabilistic inferences regarding policy regime switches, which can induce agents to counteract QE interventions and reduce their effectiveness. Originality/value: The novel features of this work are the use of a large information set including the instrument of unconventional monetary policy, the use of a structural model (Markov process) that can really inform about potential asset price reversals and the use of a large sample over which QE policies have been pursued. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Markov switching regimes; Out-of-sample forecasts; Quantitative easing; Random walk; Vector autoregression","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85139226923"

Used by governments and other decision-makers in benefit–cost analysis for over a decade, SC-CO<inf>2</inf> estimates draw on climate science, economics, demography and other disciplines. However, a 2017 report by the US National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine1 (NASEM) highlighted that current SC-CO<inf>2</inf> estimates no longer reflect the latest research. The report provided a series of recommendations for improving the scientific basis, transparency and uncertainty characterization of SC-CO<inf>2</inf> estimates. Here we show that improved probabilistic socioeconomic projections, climate models, damage functions, and discounting methods that collectively reflect theoretically consistent valuation of risk, substantially increase estimates of the SC-CO<inf>2</inf>. Our preferred mean SC-CO<inf>2</inf> estimate is $185 per tonne of CO<inf>2</inf> ($44–$413 per tCO<inf>2</inf>: 5%–95% range, 2020 US dollars) at a near-term risk-free discount rate of 2%, a value 3.6 times higher than the US government’s current value of $51 per tCO<inf>2</inf>. Our estimates incorporate updated scientific understanding throughout all components of SC-CO<inf>2</inf> estimation in the new open-source Greenhouse Gas Impact Value Estimator (GIVE) model, in a manner fully responsive to the near-term NASEM recommendations. Our higher SC-CO<inf>2</inf> values, compared with estimates currently used in policy evaluation, substantially increase the estimated benefits of greenhouse gas mitigation and thereby increase the expected net benefits of more stringent climate policies. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","","carbon dioxide; discount rate; agriculture; Article; carbon dioxide emission; climate; economic development; energy expenditure; environmental economics; environmental policy; environmental temperature; government regulation; greenhouse gas emission; gross national product; human; mortality; risk assessment; sea level rise; social aspect; socioeconomics; greenhouse gas; United States; Carbon Dioxide; Climate; Greenhouse Gases","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85139517351"

Design/methodology/approach: By using a GARCH model with a generalized error distribution (GED), this study specifies that the gold (or silver) return is a function of a set of economic and uncertainty variables, which include volatility from interest rate innovation, a change in economic policy uncertainty (EPU), a change in geopolitical risk (GPR) and volatility due to pandemic diseases, while controlling for stock market returns, inflation rates, economic growth and the Chinese currency value. Findings: This study employs monthly data of gold and silver prices over the period from January 2002 to August 2021 to examine hedging behavior. Estimated results show that the gold return is positively correlated to the stock return and a rise in uncertainty from economic policy innovation, geopolitical risk, volatility due to US interest rate innovation as well as COVID-19 infection. This result suggests that gold cannot be used to hedge against a stock market decline, but can be used to hedge against uncertainty in general. However, the silver return only responds positively to a rise in uncertainty from the inflation rate and geopolitical risk. Evidence shows that silver returns are negatively correlated with stock returns, and display hedging characteristics. However, the evidence lacks statistically significance during the COVID-19 period, suggesting that the role of silver as a safe-haven asset against stock market turmoil is weak for this time period. Research limitations/implications: More general nonlinear specifications can be developed. The tests may include different measures of uncertainty that interact with each other or with the lagged error terms. An implication of the model is that gold can be used to hedge against a broad range of uncertainties for economic policy change, political risk and/or a pandemic. However, the use of gold as an asset to hedge against a stock downturn in Chinese market should be done with caution. Practical implications: This study has important policy implications as regards a choice in assets in formatting a portfolio to hedge against uncertainty. Specifically, this study presents empirical evidence on gold and silver return behavior and finds that gold returns respond positively to heightened uncertainty. Thus, gold is a good asset to hedge against uncertainty arising from policy innovations and infectious disease uncertainty. Social implications: This paper provides insightful information on the choice of assets toward hedging against risk in the uncertainty market conditions. It provides information to investors and policy makers to use gold price movements as a signal for detecting the arrival of uncertainty. This study also provides information for demanding a risk premium for infectious disease. Originality/value: This study empirically analyzes and verifies the role that gold serves as a safe haven asset to hedge against uncertainty in the Chinese market. This paper contributes to the literature by presenting evidence of risk/uncertainty premiums for holding gold against various sources of uncertainty such as economic policy uncertainty, geopolitical risk and equity market volatility due to US interest rate innovation and/or COVID-19. This study finds evidence that supports the use of a nonlinear specification, which demonstrates the interaction of uncertainty with the lagged change of infectious disease and helps to explain the gold/silver return behavior. Further, evidence shows that the gold return is positively correlated to the stock return. This finding contrasts with evidence in the US market. However, silver returns are negatively correlated with stock returns, but this correlation becomes insignificant during the period of COVID-19. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Economic policy uncertainty; Geopolitical risk; Gold price; Inflation; Safe-haven; Silver price","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85132296653"

These assets deteriorate due to aging, environmental conditions, and other external factors. Maintaining the performance of an asset in line with rational repair strategies represents a considerable challenge for decision-makers, who may not pay attention to developing adequate maintenance plans or leave the assets unmaintained. Worldwide, organizations are under pressure to ensure the sustainability of their assets. Such organizations may burden their treasury with random maintenance operations, especially with a limited budget. This research aims to develop a generalized condition assessment approach to monitor and evaluate existing facility elements. The proposed approach represents a methodology to determine the element condition index (CI). The methodology is reinforced with an artificial neural network (ANN) model to predict the element deterioration. The performance of this model was evaluated by comparing the obtained predicted CIs with ordinary least squares (OLS) regression model results to choose the most accurate prediction technique. A case study was applied to a group of wooden doors. The ANN model showed reliable results with R2 values of 0.99, 0.98, and 0.99 for training, cross-validation, and testing sets, respectively. In contrast, the OLS model R2 value was 1.00. These results show the high prediction capability of both models with an advantage to the OLS model. Applying this approach to different elements can help decision-makers develop a preventive maintenance schedule and provide the necessary funds. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","artificial neural networks; asset management; condition assessment; condition prediction; multiple regression analysis","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85140652351"

Extensive descriptive data analysis shows that both time series feature heavy tails and conditional heteroscedasticity and show asymmetric behavior in their differences. We propose state-space time series models under skewed, heavy-tailed distributions to capture all stylized facts of the data. They include the impact of autocorrelation, seasonality, risk premia, temperature, storage levels, the price of European Emission Allowances, and related fuel prices of oil, coal, and electricity. We provide rigorous model diagnostics and interpret all model components in detail. Additionally, we conduct a probabilistic forecasting study with significance tests and compare the predictive performance against literature benchmarks.

Under the arbitrage-free assumption, we prove a parsimonious solution to the risk-neutral process that guarantees joint identification of parameters and latent states.

Towards the investment target, the primary task is selecting the stocks with potentials to obtain the highest excess returns, always regarded as stock ranking. List-wise stock ranking is able to consider the relative comparisons of multiple stocks, approaching the essence of stock ranking most. However, most existing methods fail in list-wise stock ranking, because the information complexity and small number of samples bring in training difficulties. To address these limitations, a novel Deep Multi-Task Learning (DMTL) solution is proposed, called Multi-Task Stock Ranking (MTSR). It utilizes the joint learning framework of DMTL to learn the list-wise stock ranking with the enhancements of auxiliary tasks. With DMTL, the easily-trained tasks act as learning guider, providing extra gradient backpropagation, to help learn the hardly-trained list-wise ranking task. Additionally, Task Relation Attention is utilized to capture the dynamic task relations to achieve better knowledge transfer between tasks. The experiments conducted on real-world stock datasets demonstrate the superiority of MTSR over several state-of-the-art methods. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Deep neural networks; Multi-task learning; Stock prediction; Stock ranking","Backpropagation; Computational complexity; Forecasting; Knowledge management; Excess returns; Future trends; Information complexity; Multi tasks; Multitask learning; Number of samples; Primary task; Stock predictions; Stock ranking; Task relations; Deep neural networks","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85127127011"

This is because Bitcoin achieved a market capitalization of more than US$1 tn over this period, gaining market attention and acceptance from retail, corporate and institutional investors. Second, the authors employed a VECM with the six macroeconomic variables. Finally, the authors expanded the long-run equilibrium relationship (time-invariant cointegration)-based VECM to develop a time-varying cointegration (TVC) VECM. The authors estimated the TVC VECM using the Chebyshev polynomial specification based on various information criteria. The results showed that the Bitcoin price can be modeled with the VECM (p = 1, r = 1). The TVC approach generated more explanatory power for Bitcoin pricing, indicating the effectiveness of the approach for modeling the long-run relationship between Bitcoin price and macroeconomic variables. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Bitcoin price; Chebyshev polynomials; Johansen test; Time-varying cointegration; Vector error correction model","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85150338859"

The performance of the AI stock market recovered quicker than the conventional stock market when the pandemic went into its third month. The results suggest that the AI stocks were more resilient than conventional stocks when the financial market was exposed to uncertainty caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. The deployment of AI in firms serves as a resilient, crucial driver for sustainable performance in challenging environments.

The rolling out of this screening method was in large part driven by commercial firms, which hoped to reach a huge potential market by offering a test that was expected to be risk-free, reliable, inexpensive, and able to detect a wide range of genetic traits of the future child. To date, most predictions about the scope and uses of NIPT have not materialized: in 2020 NIPT detects only a limited number of genetic anomalies, while results have to be confirmed by amniocentesis. NIPT has become a commercial success. Nevertheless the implementation of NIPT has tended to diverge across different national settings. In countries that already have state-sponsored screening for Down risk, NIPT has been offered by the state health insurance to women defined as “high risk”, using a variant of the test that detects only three autosomal aneuploidies: trisomy 21, 13 and 18. These countries effectively regulate the supply of NIPT on grounds of cost-effectiveness and reliability. In countries without state-sponsored screening for Down risk, in contrast, multiple versions of NIPT covering a wider range of birth defects are commonly available on the free market, and purchased by women at low as well as high risk of having an affected child. Market-based healthcare systems tend to present women who can afford to pay for NIPT with a largely unregulated choice of technologies – though reimbursement rules imposed by private insurance providers may serve in effect to regulate use by those consumers who cannot afford to pay for tests from their own pockets. This regulatory divergence is shaped by the presence or absence of prior state-sponsored screening programs for Down risk. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Amniocentesis; Circulating free fetal DNA; Down syndrome; Fetus; Genetic testing; Non-invasive prenatal diagnosis; Pregnancy; Selective abortion","abortion; commercialization; detection method; DNA; genetic analysis; innovation; pregnancy; womens health; amniocentesis; anemia; aneuploidy; Article; congenital adrenal hyperplasia; controlled study; DiGeorge syndrome; Down syndrome; female; genetic screening; health care system; human; noninvasive prenatal testing; pregnant woman; prenatal screening; reimbursement; sickle cell anemia; trisomy 21; child; genetics; prenatal diagnosis; procedures; reproducibility; trisomy; Child; Down Syndrome; Female; Genetic Testing; Humans; Pregnancy; Prenatal Diagnosis; Reproducibility of Results; Trisomy","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85086363099"

The main purpose of the present study is related to designing and implementation of real-time monitoring, prediction, and control system for flood disaster management as a DSS. Likewise, the problem of statement in the research is correlated to implementation of a system for different climates of Iran as a unique flood control system. For the first time, this study coupled hydrological data mining, Machine Learning (ML), and Multi-Criteria Decision Making (MCDM) as smart alarm and prevention systems. Likewise, it created the platform for conditional management of floods in Iran's different clusters of climates. According to the KMeans clustering system, which determines homogeneity of the hydrology of a specific region, Iran's rainfall is heterogeneous with 0.61 score, which is approved high efficiency of clustering in a vast country such as Iran with four seasons and different climates. In contrast, the relation of rainfall and flood disaster is evaluated by Nearest Neighbors Classification (NNC), Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD), Gaussian Process Classifier (GPC), and Neural Network (NN) algorithms which have an acceptable correlation coefficient with a mean of 0.7. The machine learning outputs demonstrated that based on valid data existence problems in developing countries, just with verified precipitation records, the flood disaster can be estimated with high efficiency. In the following, Technique for Order of Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS) method as a Game Theory (GT) technique ranked the preventive flood damages strategies through three social (Se 1), environmental (Se 2), and economic (Se 3) crises scenarios. The solutions of flood disaster management are collected from literature review, and the opinion approves them of 9 senior experts who are retired from a high level of water resource management positions of Iran. The outcomes of the TOPSIS method proved that National announcement for public-institutional participation for rapid response and funding (G1-2), Establishment of delay structures to increase flood focus time to give the animals in the ecosystem the opportunity to escape to the upstream points and to preserve the habitat (G 2–8), and Granting free national financial resources by government agencies in order to rebuild sensitive infrastructure such as railways, hospitals, schools, etc. to the provincial treasury (G3-10) are selected as the best solution of flood management in Social, Environmental, and Economic crises, respectively.

This paper employs a design science approach and proposes a new composite metric, eigen attention centrality (EAC), as a proxy for information flows associated with a node that considers both attention to a node and coattention with other nodes in a network. We apply the EAC metric in the context of financial market where nodes are individual stocks and edges are based on coattention relationships among stocks. Composite information from different channels is used to measure attention and coattention. To evaluate the effectiveness of the EAC metric on predicting outcomes, we conduct an in-depth performance evaluation of the EAC metric by (1) using multiple linear and nonlinear prediction methods and (2) comparing EAC with a benchmark model without EAC and models with a set of alternative network metrics. Our analysis shows that EAC significantly outperforms other measures in predicting the direction and magnitude of abnormal returns of stocks. Besides, our EAC specification has better predictive performance than alternative specifications, and EAC outperforms direct attention in predicting abnormal returns. Using the EAC metric, we derive a stock portfolio and develop a trading strategy that provides significant and positive excess returns. Lastly, we find that composite information has significantly better predictive performance than separate information sources, and such superior performance owes to information from social media instead of traditional media. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","attention; coattention; Eigen attention centrality; information flow; network analysis; network structure; return prediction","Benchmarking; Commerce; Financial markets; Social networking (online); Specifications; Abnormal returns; Attention; Coattention; Eigen attention centrality; Flows in networks; Information flows; Network structures; Predictive performance; Return prediction; Social media; Forecasting","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85134654663"

We define a market state with recurrent neural network (RNN) volatility predictions and construct an investment strategy that dynamically combines equity, cash, and safe havens. The equity is allocated by targeting the volatility, and investing in safe havens depends on the predicted market state. We consider the S&P500 index with 13 safe haven assets, such as long-term government bonds, commodities, gold, and other precious metals. Other indices, NIKKEI225, NIFTY50, and STOXX50, are examined for robustness. With analysis conducted over a 20-year sample period, we find that RNN delivers sound predictions to construct the volatility targeting strategy. Among considered assets, only long-term Treasury bonds act as a safe haven and improve the strategy performance. Other considered assets have no such potential.

In doing so, the authors compare European and US firms and consider nonlinear and indirect effects. This complements the previous literature focusing on linear and direct effects using bond yields and credit ratings of US firms. Design/methodology/approach: For this purpose, the authors apply fixed effects regressions on a comprehensive panel data set of US and European firms. Further, nonlinear and indirect effects are investigated utilizing quantile regressions and a path analysis. Findings: The evidence indicates that higher ESG ratings mitigate credit risks of US and European firms from 2007 to 2019. The risk mitigation effect is U-shaped across ESG quantiles, which is consistent with opposing effects of growing stakeholder influence capacity and diminishing marginal returns on ESG investments. The authors further reveal a mediating indirect volatility channel that substantially amplifies the direct effect of ESG on credit risk. A one-standard-deviation improvement in ESG ratings is estimated to reduce CDS spreads of low, medium and high ESG firms by approximately 4%, 8% and 3%, respectively. Originality/value: This is the first study to examine whether credit markets reflect regional differences between Europe and the US with regard to the ESG-CDS-relationship. In addition, this paper contributes to the existing literature by investigating differences in the response of CDS spreads across ESG quantiles and to study potential indirect channels connecting ESG and CDS spreads using structural credit risk variables. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Corporate social responsibility (CSR); Credit risk; Credit default swaps (CDS); Environmental; Governance (ESG); Social","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85124343222"

However, minimal research has been conducted to formulate efficient models that can quantify optimal governmental investments. To bridge the gap, an integrated model of the investment savings-liquidity preference money supply (IS-LM) curve and the dynamic stochastic general equilibrium (DSGE) analysis was developed to investigate the balance of supply and demand during deflation status in addition to the associated spending adjustment mechanisms. The most recent data were analyzed, and the deep parameters were obtained using Bayesian estimation via the Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) technique. The analysis result showed that public investment within economies in a deflationary state, which is in a liquidity trap, are expected to crowd out private investment. Also, due to the issuance of government bonds during deflation, the effect of public investment in this situation is more significant than that during inflation. Therefore, decision makers can use the proposed model to manage and quantify the highway construction and maintenance sector's governmental annual optimal investment. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Highway construction; Investment savings-liquidity preference money supply (IS-LM) curve; Private sector; Public investment","Bayesian networks; Construction industry; Decision making; Economics; Highway engineering; Markov processes; Monte Carlo methods; Stochastic models; Stochastic systems; Construction sectors; Governmental investments; Highway construction; Integrated modeling; Investment saving; Investment saving-liquidity preference money supply curve; Money supply; Private sectors; Public investments; Supply curves; Investments","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85122233790"

A number of rules and barriers exist in the Chinese A-share market such as trading restrictions and high fees, as well as scarce and expensive hedging tools. It is difficult to achieve stable absolute returns in such a market. Stock correlation analysis and price prediction play an important role to achieve any profitable trading. The portfolio management and subsequent trading decisions highly depend on the results of stock correlation analysis and price prediction. However, it is nontrivial to analyze and predict any stocks, being time-varying and affected by unlimited factors in a given market. Traditional methods only take some certain factors into consideration but ignore others that may be changed dynamically. In this paper, we propose a novel machine learning model named Graph Attention Long Short-Term Memory (GALSTM) to learn the correlations between stocks and predict their future prices automatically. First, a multi-Hawkes Process is used to initial a correlation graph between stocks. This procedure provides a good training start as the multi-Hawkes Processes will be studied on the most saint feature fluctuations with any correlations being statistically significant. Then an attention-based LSTM is built to learn the weighting matrix underlying the dynamic graph. In addition, we also build matching data process plus portfolio management modules to form a complete system. The proposed GALSTM enables us to expand the scope of stock selection under the premise of controlling risks with limited hedging tools in the A-share market, thereby effectively increasing high-frequency excess returns. We then construct a long and short positions combination, select long positions in the A shares of the entire market, and use stock index futures to short. With GALSTM model, the products managed by our fully automatic quantitative trading system achieved an absolute annual return rate of 44.71% and the standard deviation of daily returns is only 0.42% in three months of operation.

Through the analysis and research of related indexes, the change rules of different indexes are obtained, and the optimization model is used to calculate and forecast the excess return of stocks. The results show that the statistics and spectral radius show typical local linear variation with the increase of eigenvalue. The corresponding statistics show a trend of gradual increase. The corresponding spectral radius has a decreasing variation law, and the two curves have obvious symmetry at some eigenvalues. It can be seen from the change curves under different factors that the change trend of the yield curve is mainly affected by the investment factor, while the change rule of the specific value of the yield curve is controlled by the profit factor. This shows that the two factors have the same influence on the stock excess return. The influence of optimized deep learning model on stock excess index has typical linear characteristics, which can be divided into linear increase and linear decline according to different change rules. The basic type has the greatest influence, while the corresponding pattern analysis type has the least influence. Finally, the method of experimental verification is used to verify the stock excess data, and the results show that the optimized deep learning model can better characterize the experimental results. Therefore, the optimized deep learning model based on nonlinear random matrix and esg factor can carry out targeted analysis of different types of stock returns, thus improving research ideas and calculation methods for the application of deep learning model in different fields. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","","Deep learning; Eigenvalues and eigenfunctions; Learning systems; Matrix algebra; Nonlinear analysis; Eigen-value; Excess returns; Learning models; Prediction-based; Random Matrix; Spectral radius; Statistical datas; Traditional learning; Traditional models; Yield curve; Investments","Article","Final","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85138911288"

During the period, the central government always dominated the changing direction of the local government bond system. However, as fiscal decentralization reform has progressed, the institutional needs of local governments and investors have gradually gained attention. As a result, the size and variety of local government bonds are expanding. Through the introduction of analysis of system change based on situation structure performance (SSP), this paper uses Machine Learning (ML) approaches to predict the risk of government debt of China in the context of changing the local government bond system. Besides, this research work includes the comprehensive weight assignment for government debt hazard, fiscal revenue forecasting, default risk calculation, and finally an analysis of the validity of government debt hazard. The system may provide financial signal advice and strategy reference for dealing with hazards in early payment, organizing debt repayment significance order, optimizing fiscal revenue and cost structure, and so on. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","","Economics; Risk analysis; Risk assessment; Central government; Decentralisation; Default risk; Government bonds; Local government; Machine learning approaches; Risk calculation; Structure performance; System change; Weight assignment; Hazards","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85136545711"

Consequently, it proposes a financial SIM model using deep Q network (DQN) as reinforcement earning (RL) algorithm and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) as deep neural network (DNN). Then, after training and optimization, the proposed model is back-tested. The research findings are as follows: the LSTM neural network (NN)-based model will import the observation of the market at each time and the change of transaction information over time. The LSTM network can find and learn the potential relationship between time series data. There are two hidden layers and one output layer in the model. The hidden layer is an LSTM structure and the output layer is the fully connected NN. DQN algorithm first stores the experience sample data of the agent-environment interaction into the experience pool. It then randomly selects a small batch of data from the experience pool to train the network. Doing so removes the correlation and dependence between samples so that the DNN model can better learn the value function in the RL task. The model can predict the future state according to historical information and decide which actions to take in the next step. Meanwhile, five stocks of Chinese A-shares are selected to form an asset pool. The initial 500,000 amount of the account is divided into five equal shares, which are invested and traded. Overall, the model account's rate of return (RoR) during the back-test is 32.12%. The Shanghai Stock Exchange (SSI) has risen by 19.157% in the same period. Thus, the model's performance has exceeded the SSI's in the same period. E stock has the maximum RoR of 78.984%. The RoR of A, B, and C stocks is 54.129%, 11.594%, and 9.815%, respectively. B stock presents a minimum RoR of 6.084%. All these stocks have got positive returns. Therefore, the proposed financial SIM based on the DL algorithm is scientific and feasible. The research content has certain significant reference for the DL-based financial SIM. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","","Commerce; Earnings; Financial markets; Internet of things; Investments; Learning algorithms; Long short-term memory; Neural network models; Excess returns; Hidden layers; Investment management; Learn+; Management Model; Network-based modeling; Neural-networks; Optimisations; Output layer; Rate of return; Deep neural networks; algorithm; China; investment; Algorithms; Deep Learning; Internet of Things","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85134893964"

Then, it analyzes these research samples and imports the relevant data of 111 stocks into the DL NN model. The corresponding prediction results of stock prices are obtained. Finally, the stock portfolio model based on DL NN is compared with the data results of the Shanghai Stock Exchange (SSE) 50 Index and CSI 500 Index. The results show that the closing prices of the selected 111 stocks are relatively stable and fluctuate up and down around the horizontal axis, and the positive and negative returns are relatively balanced, roughly between -5% and 5%. There is a phenomenon of fluctuation aggregation to a certain extent. Comparing the prediction results of different models reveals that the prediction results of model c are closest to the actual stock price trend. Comparing the relevant returns of the proposed stock portfolio with other stocks uncovers that the annualized return of the stock portfolio based on the DL NN model is 47.44%. The sharp ratio is 1.52, the maximum pullback is 18.15%, the monthly excess return is 3.11%, and the information ratio is 0.82.

National Treasury’s intentions for fiscal consolidation have again drawn attention to the fiscal multiplier literature. Aim: The aim in the study is to calculate the size of fiscal expenditure multipliers over the period 2009 to 2019, taking into account the specific economic conditions and the funding choices of government. Setting: In the study fiscal policy is considered at a time when the debt to gross domestic product (GDP) ratio was rising rapidly. Methods: We use an econometric model to calculate the fiscal multipliers over the past decade. Our estimates take account of the specific fiscal conditions for each year, in particular the changing relationship between debt and the sovereign risk premia as well as the impact of tax increases. Results: The model suggests that the fiscal multiplier declined from 1.5 in 2010 to around zero in 2019 as the debt levels became progressively more unsustainable and large tax increases muted the aggregate demand effects from higher government expenditure. Conclusion: The low fiscal multipliers suggest that fiscal consolidation will be less costly in terms of growth forgone than generally perceived. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","econometric model; fiscal multipliers; fiscal policy; South Africa","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85128767443"

Because of their unique monetary systems, governments in most emerging markets play a key role in bond returns. This study identifies macroeconomic factors for forecasting excess returns in emerging government bond markets under spanning hypothesis. We find that in previous research, government intervention factors employed in excess returns forecasting have no additional predictive ability, as they are already incorporated in current yields. Using dynamic factor analysis, we find that macroeconomic information, including pure macroeconomic activities and financial factors, has robust incremental predictive power for in-sample and out-of-sample bond excess returns. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Bond returns; emerging market; macroeconomic factors; monetary system","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85109852085"

For online portfolio selection, transaction costs incurred by changes of investment proportions on risky assets have a significant impact on the investment strategy and the return in long-term investment horizon. However, in many online portfolio selection studies, transaction costs are usually neglected in the decision making process. In this paper, we consider an adaptive online portfolio selection problem with transaction costs. We first propose an adaptive online moving average method (AOLMA) to predict the future returns of risky assets by incorporating an adaptive decaying factor into the moving average method, which improves the accuracy of return prediction. The net profit maximization model (NPM) is then constructed where transaction costs are considered in each decision making process. The adaptive online net profit maximization algorithm (AOLNPM) is designed to maximize the cumulative return by integrating AOLMA and NPM together. Numerical experiments show that AOLNPM dominates several state-of-the-art online portfolio selection algorithms in terms of various performance metrics, i.e., cumulative return, mean excess return, Sharpe ratio, Information ratio and Calmar ratio. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Adaptive moving average method; Decision support systems; Linear programming; Online portfolio selection; Transaction cost","Costs; Decision making; Decision support systems; E-learning; Investments; Linear programming; Machine learning; Adaptive moving average method; Decision supports; Linear-programming; Net profits; Online portfolio selection; Online portfolios; Portfolio selection; Profit maximization; Support systems; Transaction cost; Profitability","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85103966971"

The ERNN model is one of the neural network models that adjusts the input using the output feedback from the hidden layer. The BL portfolio is generated based on the capital assets pricing model (CAPM) excess return equilibrium. The data used in CAPM model must fulfill the normality assumption which is checked by using Jarque Bera test. The selected stocks for the portfolio are the member of LQ-45 stocks which meet the normality assumption and have the highest expected excess return CAPM value, those are AKRA, BBNI, INCO, and JSMR stocks. The ERNN model is employed to those stocks to obtain the views prediction. Then, the Black-Litterman portfolio is constructed by combining the ERNN views of the stock returns and the expected equilibrium return yielded by the capital assets pricing model. Three designs of relative views are considered, each design is distinguished from the percentage of each stock return prediction.

However, its volatility and brand new trading mode has made it challenging to devising an acceptable automatically-generating strategy. This study proposes a framework for automatic high-frequency bitcoin transactions based on a deep reinforcement learning algorithm — proximal policy optimization (PPO). The framework creatively regards the transaction process as actions, returns as awards and prices as states to align with the idea of reinforcement learning. It compares advanced machine learning-based models for static price predictions including support vector machine (SVM), multi-layer perceptron (MLP), long short-term memory (LSTM), temporal convolutional network (TCN), and Transformer by applying them to the real-time bitcoin price and the experimental results demonstrate that LSTM outperforms. Then an automatically-generating transaction strategy is constructed building on PPO with LSTM as the basis to construct the policy. Extensive empirical studies validate that the proposed method perform superiorly to various common trading strategy benchmarks for a single financial product. The approach is able to trade bitcoins in a simulated environment with synchronous data and obtains a 31.67% more return than that of the best benchmark, improving the benchmark by 12.75%. The proposed framework can earn excess returns through both the period of volatility and surge, which opens the door to research on building a single cryptocurrency trading strategy based on deep learning. Visualizations of trading the process show how the model handles high-frequency transactions to provide inspiration and demonstrate that it can be expanded to other financial products. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Bitcoin; Deep reinforcement learning; High-frequency trading strategies; Proximal policy optimization","Bitcoin; Electronic trading; Investments; Learning algorithms; Reinforcement learning; Support vector machines; Asset allocation; Decentralisation; Financial products; High frequency HF; High-frequency trading; High-frequency trading strategy; Policy optimization; Proximal policy optimization; Reinforcement learning algorithms; Trading strategies; Long short-term memory","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85117191473"

These systems typically fail to account for word meaning, even though word sense disambiguation is crucial for text understanding. Therefore, we propose an advanced natural language processing pipeline for event-based stock price prediction, that allows for word sense disambiguation to be incorporated in the event detection process. We identify events in natural language news messages and subsequently weight these events for their historical impact on stock prices. We assess the merit of word sense disambiguation in event-based stock price prediction in two evaluation scenarios for NASDAQ-100 companies, based on historical stock prices and news articles retrieved from Dow Jones Newswires over a 2-year period. We evaluate the precision of generated buy and sell signals based on our predicted stock price movements, as well as the excess returns generated by a trading strategy that acts upon these signals. Event-based stock price predictions seem most reliable about 2 days into the future. The number of detected events tends to reduce with over 30% when graph-based word sense disambiguation using a degree centrality measure is applied in the event detection process, thus reducing the noise introduced into the stock price movement predictions by high-impact ambiguous events. As a result, modest improvements in the precision of buy and sell signals generated based on these predictions tend to lead to vast improvements of on average about 70% in the associated excess returns. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Event detection; Natural language processing; Stock price prediction; Word sense disambiguation","Artificial intelligence; Costs; Decision support systems; Financial markets; Graphic methods; Natural language processing systems; Detection process; Event-based; Events detection; Excess returns; Language processing; Natural languages; State of the art; Stock price; Stock price prediction; Word Sense Disambiguation; Forecasting","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85109887638"

This paper introduces a new algorithm for exploiting time-series predictability-based patterns to obtain an abnormal return, or alpha, with respect to a given benchmark asset pricing model. The algorithm proposes a deterministic daily market timing strategy that decides between being fully invested in a risky asset or in a risk-free asset, with the trading rule represented by a parametric perceptron. The optimal parameters are sought in-sample via differential evolution to directly maximize the alpha. Successively using two modern asset pricing models and two different portfolio weighting schemes, the algorithm was able to discover an undocumented anomaly in the United States stock market cross-section, both out-of-sample and using small transaction costs. The new algorithm represents a simple and flexible alternative to technical analysis and forecast-based trading rules, neither of which necessarily maximizes the alpha. This new algorithm was inspired by recent insights into representing reinforcement learning as evolutionary computation. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Alpha maximization; Artificial intelligence; Evolutionary computation; Investment algorithm; Machine learning; Market timing; Perceptron; Reinforcement learning; Stock market; Trading rules","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85123798331"

Besides, in order to capture dynamic interaction between yield curve and macroeconomic/financial factors, a panel vector autoregressive (VAR) analysis based on the system generalized method of moments (GMM) approach is utilized. Empirical results suggest that the level factor responds to shocks originated from inflation, domestic financial variables, and global variables. Furthermore, the slope factor is affected by shocks in global variables, and the curvature factor appears to be influenced by domestic financial variables. We also show that macroeconomic/financial factors captures significant predictive information over yield curve factors by running individual country factor-augmented predictive regressions and variable selection algorithms such ridge regression, least absolute shrinkage operator (LASSO), and Elastic Net.

This paper explores how useful analyst expected price data are for forecasting when appropriate measures are taken to account for their sparse nature and high volatility. It proposes a multifactor stochastic pricing model, with time-varying risk premiums calibrated with filtered futures and analyst forecasts using a Kalman Filter. The forecasting model is applied to ten years of oil prices and analyst forecasts, from NYMEX and Bloomberg, respectively.

(2016) to predict economic variables out-of-sample. Using simple predictive regressions à la Goyal and Welch (2008), we evaluate the predictive power afforded by various nonlinear transformations of the U.S. EPU measure suggested in Baker et al. (2016) to predict excess returns on the S&P 500 index one-month ahead. Using data from 1985m1 through 2020m12, we find that not all EPU movements are equally important for obtaining point prediction improvements relative to the historical average benchmark at the population level. Particularly, we document that the one-year net EPU increase, defined as EPU increases beyond the peak over the last year, otherwise zero delivers the most consistent pattern of prediction improvements relative to the benchmark. Conversely, other nonlinear specifications as well as the linear models using log-EPU and the first difference of log-EPU do not deliver the same performance. Overall, this study documents that the predictive impact of the U.S. EPU index suggested in Baker et al. (2016) on equity premium is nonlinear in that EPU increases matter only to the extent that they exceed the maximum value over the last twelve months. In other words, there is evidence of threshold nonlinearity. The statistical predictive power afforded by the one-year net EPU increase also translates into economic gains. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Equity premium; News-based economic policy uncertainty; Nonlinearity; Population-level predictability; Portfolio optimization","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85108704036"

This paper proposes a method of estimating the market price of volatility risk by incorporating both conditional heteroscedasticity and nonlinear effects in market returns, while accounting for asymmetric shocks. We develop a model that allows dynamic risk premiums for the underlying asset and for the volatility of the asset under the physical measure. Specifically, a nonlinear in mean time series model combining the asymmetric autoregressive conditional heteroscedastic model with leverage (NGARCH) is adapted for modeling return dynamics. The local risk-neutral valuation relationship is used to model investors’ preferences of volatility risk. The transition probabilities governing the evolution of the price of the underlying asset are adjusted for investors’ attitude towards risk, presenting the asset returns as a function of the risk premium. Numerical studies on asset return data show the significance of market shocks and levels of asymmetry in pricing the volatility risk. Estimated premiums could be used in option pricing models, turning options markets into volatility trading markets, and in measuring reactions to market shocks. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Diffusion limit; News impact curve; NGARCH model; Stochastic volatility; Volatility risk premium","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85114048678"

However, the traditional optimal power flow (OPF)-based total transfer capability calculation is computationally expensive for efficient total transfer capability control due to the inclusion of a large set of differential-algebraic equations (DAEs) to verify transient stability constraints. In order to enable practicable total transfer capability regulation, a novel risk-aware deep learning-assisted paradigm is proposed here. First, a deep belief network (DBN) is employed to establish the total transfer capability predictor and surrogate the computation-intensive differential-algebraic equations in original optimal power flow formulas, simplifying the high-dimensional and intractable constraints deep belief networks without loss of nonlinearity. Particularly, in order to be aware of control risk from the predictive error of the deep belief networks, prediction intervals (PIs) are produced improved by using ensemble learning and used to disclose the probability of insufficient actions, further guaranteeing the sufficient and cost-effective control by compromising the tradeoff between cost and risk. Symbiotic organisms search (SOS) is then applied to solve the proposed risk-aware deep belief network-assisted total transfer capability control problem globally. The numerical studies testify that the proposed method enables economical, reliable, and full nonlinearity-retained dynamic total transfer capability regulation control within a risk-free surrogate-assisted and tractable physical model-driven hybrid framework. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","deep learning; ensemble learning; global search; prediction intervals; surrogate-assisted model; total transfer capability","Acoustic generators; Algebra; Bayesian networks; Control nonlinearities; Cost effectiveness; Differential equations; Electric load flow; Electric power transmission; Numerical methods; Risks; Computation intensives; Deep belief network (DBN); Deep belief networks; Differential algebraic equations; Optimal power flows; Through transmission; Total transfer capability; Transient stability constraints; Deep learning","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85101158129"

Recently, several approaches using deep neural networks (DNNs) such as recurrent neural networks (RNNs) have been introduced for TS forecasting and have shown promising results. However, the applicability of these approaches is being questioned for TS settings where there is a lack of quality training data and where the TS to forecast exhibit complex behaviors. Examples of such settings include financial TS forecasting, where producing accurate and consistent long-term forecasts is notoriously difficult. In this work, we investigate whether DNN-based models can be used to forecast these TS conjointly by learning a joint representation of the series instead of computing the forecast from the raw time-series representations. To this end, we make use of the dynamic factor graph (DFG) to build a multivariate autoregressive model. We investigate a common limitation of RNNs that rely on the DFG framework and propose a novel variable-length attention-based mechanism (ACTM) to address it. With ACTM, it is possible to vary the autoregressive order of a TS model over time and model a larger set of probability distributions than with previous approaches. Using this mechanism, we propose a self-supervised DNN architecture for multivariate TS forecasting that learns and takes advantage of the relationships between them. We test our model on two datasets covering 19 years of investment fund activities. Our experimental results show that the proposed approach significantly outperforms typical DNN-based and statistical models at forecasting the 21-day price trajectory. We point out how improving forecasting accuracy and knowing which forecaster to use can improve the excess return of autonomous trading strategies. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Dynamic factor graphs; Neural networks; Semi-supervised learning; Time series forecasting","Decision making; Deep neural networks; Financial data processing; Forecasting; Probability distributions; Time series; Adaptive neural networks; Financial time series; Forecasting accuracy; Long-term forecast; Long-term forecasting; Multivariate autoregressive models; Optimal decision making; Recurrent neural network (RNNs); Recurrent neural networks","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85101315001"

In this study, we develop a new forecasting approach referred to as FSPSOSVR, which is able to accurately predict exchange rates by combining particle swarm optimization (PSO), random forest feature selection, and support vector regression (SVR). PSO is used to obtain the optimal SVR parameters for predicting exchange rates. Our analysis involves the monthly exchange rates from January 1971 to December 2017 of seven countries including Australia, Canada, China, the European Union, Japan, Taiwan, and the United Kingdom. The out-of-sample forecast performance of the FSPSOSVR algorithm is compared with six competing forecasting models using the mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) and root mean square error (RMSE), including random walk, exponential smoothing, autoregres-sive integrated moving average (ARIMA), seasonal ARIMA, SVR, and PSOSVR. Our empirical results show that the FSPSOSVR algorithm consistently yields excellent predictive accuracy, which compares favorably with competing models for all currencies. These findings suggest that the proposed algorithm is a promising method for the empirical forecasting of exchange rates. Finally, we show the empirical relevance of exchange rate forecasts arising from FSPSOSVR by use of foreign exchange carry trades and find that the proposed trading strategies can deliver positive excess returns of more than 3% per annum for most currencies, except for AUD and NTD. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Exchange rates; Forecasting; Machine learning; Particle swarm optimization (PSO); Support vector machines (SVM)","accuracy assessment; algorithm; currency; European Union; exchange rate; financial services; forecasting method; international cooperation; monetary policy; optimization; regression analysis; Australia; Canada; China; Japan; Taiwan; United Kingdom","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85102711580"

This model’s significant advantage is its intuitive and reactive design that incorporates the latest asset return regimes to quantitatively solve managers’ question: how certain should one be that a given investment view is occurring? First, we describe a framework for multi-period portfolio allocation formulated as a convex optimization problem that trades off expected return, risk and transaction costs. Using a framework borrowed from model predictive control introduced by Boyd et al., we employ optimization to plan a sequence of trades using forecasts of future quantities, only the first set being executed. Multi-period trading lends itself to dynamic readjustment of the portfolio when gaining new information. Second, we use the Black-Litterman model to combine investment views specified in a simple linear combination based format with the market portfolio. A data-driven method to adjust the confidence in the manager’s views by comparing them to dynamically updated regime-switching forecasts is proposed. Our contribution is to incorporate both multi-period trading and interpretable investment views into one framework and offer a novel method of using regime-switching to determine each view’s confidence. This method replaces portfolio managers’ need to provide estimated confidence levels for their views, substituting them with a dynamic quantitative approach. The framework is reactive, tractable and tested on 15 years of daily historical data. In a numerical example, this method’s benefits are found to deliver higher excess returns for the same degree of risk in both the case when an investment view proves to be correct, but, more notably, also the case when a view proves to be incorrect. To facilitate ease of use and future research, we also developed an open-source software library that replicates our results. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Black Litterman; dynamic asset allocation; hidden markov models; investment views; multi-period portfolio optimization; receding horizon; regime switching","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85165752842"

The reforms in general practice have primarily been driven by the discussions of the implications of climate change and environmental degradation. Central to the discussion has been the social discount rate, used to value future costs and benefits in the present, and also the dual discount rates for “environmental goods”, as goods that are of no, or of risky substitution. Official rates, in many nations, are calculated using the “Ramsey” formula. The literature has explored the relevant factors in this formula, but with less attention paid to the selection of the rate of future growth in consumption, or to the setting of dual discount rates in national practice guidance. Through considering the case of Ireland, this study demonstrates that the selection of growth rates in consumption, in the context of future uncertainty, requires the use of plausible scenarios, rather than historical trends or forecasts. By employing economic scenarios, alongside established values for the other factors, the main discount rate for Ireland is calculated in a range of 1.7 to 2.8 per cent. Seperately, a dual discount rate, for capital that cannot be replaced, is estimated at ≤1.3 per cent. The main discount rate is validated by comparison against discount rates found in the literature, applied in other comparable nations, and by the rate estimated from the real yield on government bonds. All four independent lines of evidence support the range estimated. This demonstrates that the Irish government’s estimated discount rate, of 4.0 per cent, is not credible, and needs reduction, alongside introduction of dual discounting. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","cost-benefit analysis; economic growth; project evaluation; social discount rate; sustainability; transition","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85125930735"

We show the importance of incorporating “Big Data” into family policy analysis to address the problem of data completeness and analytical information for family policy needs. We rely on A. Sagradov’s ideas about quantitative determination of population reproduction patterns with non-demographic processes, including institutional changes and transformation of economic mechanisms of family policy. We estimated the demographic result per unit of budget expenditures in Russia (based on empirical data from EMISS and the Federal Treasury for 86 regions from 2011 to 2021, with a breakdown by months). The “random forest” method is used to identify the key factors influencing the results of the machine learning model, and to demonstrate the significance of parameters for assessing the socio-economic effectiveness of family policy in Russia. The research findings indirectly confirm the pro-natalist nature of family policy in Russia, the effectiveness of which is ensured by economic mechanisms of direct cash payments to the population.

In the first step, we estimate the production function characterised by the directional output distance function (DODF). In the second one, we use two metaheuristics (PSO and GA) to assess the optimal asset allocation (OAA). The empirical results show that the proportion allocated to the 'alternative investment with high-risk high-return' (AIhh) is on average lower than those found in previous studies. However, the percentage allocated to the 'risk-free assets' (RFA) is on average different from zero. This can be explained by the attention given to the competitiveness, survival and long-term profitability respecting the maximisation of TE. So, any insurance company must give more attention to the presence of different stakeholders and resolve the conflicts of interest between them. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Asset allocation; Insurance companies; Metaheuristics; Production function; Technical efficiency","Economics; Investments; Particle swarm optimization (PSO); Asset allocation; Conflicts of interest; Insurance companies; Non-life insurance companies; Output distance function; Production function; Technical efficiency; Utility functions; Insurance","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85109573523"

This finding is consistent with the shareholder view and over-investment hypothesis of CSR as management makes an investment in CSR to get personal benefits, which resultantly leads the firm toward financial distress state. Further, this positive relationship remains present for firms having strong involvement in foreign business through exports. Research limitations/implications: Like other studies, the present study is not free from limitations. First, financial firms are skipped from the sample, although literature witnesses a lot of studies highlight the financial firms’ commitment to achieving CSR goals. Second, financial distress occurs in different stages, and this study fails to establish a linkage between CSR engagement at different stages of financial distress. In the future, researchers can make valuable addition by covering these missing links in present studies. Practical implications: Findings suggest several practical implications. For policymakers, they should encourage firms to adopt more socially responsible behavior as it not only prevents them from distress but also comes with better investment behavior, minimize bankruptcies and make economies more strong and stable. Second, results suggest corporate managers emphasize socially responsible behavior as its benefits are beyond the “societal benefits” as it lessens financial distress through lower cost of debt, lesser financial constraints and reduced cost of information asymmetry, and it minimizes the cost of capital. Lastly, investors make risk premium assessments related to future earnings by determining the likelihood of financial distress in the future. Originality/value: The study extends the body of existing literature on CSR and the likelihood of financial distress in Pakistan, which is according to the best knowledge of the authors, not yet studied before. The results suggest that policymakers may pay special attention to the quality of CSR while predicting corporate financial distress. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Corporate social responsibility; Financial distress; Pakistan Stock Exchange; Z-score","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85107835740"

Brand alliances, whereby two or more brands are jointly presented to the consumer, have been investigated extensively. The importance of brand alliances is emphasized by two factors: (1) brands are considered critical elements in business-to-business marketing settings; and (2) firms use brand alliances due to the trading costs and investment necessary to buy brands, the increasingly higher costs of launching a new brand onto the market, the high failure rates in new brand launches and brand extensions, the competitive pressures around product launches and diffusion, and the limitations imposed on the extension of a brand by its own identity. Consequently, brand alliances have exploded over recent years. As indicated later, by accomplishing the purpose of this research we fill a gap in the literature as most of the research on brand alliances revolves around consumers’ perspective. Methodology/Approach: The methodology followed is based on the event study method. First, the event study estimates the excess returns of share prices generated by events that were unanticipated by the market. To this end, we estimate the market model and the subsequent abnormal returns. To examine the impact of the publication of a brand alliance announcement on the share prices of the company, we use the cumulative abnormal returns calculated over k days of the event window for 55 announcements. In the second step, we analyze the returns of the different brand alliances. In particular, the abnormal returns are used as dependent variable in a regression analysis, wherein the central explanatory variable is brand alliance type (co-branding vs joint promotion). Finally, the third stage of the methodology analyzes the change in the variance of returns between the periods before and after the brand alliance announcements. Findings: The results show that brand alliance announcements generate positive abnormal returns, which support the hypothesis that brand alliance announcements are positively related to company stock returns. In particular, we observe that the reactions to brand alliances are spread over the event window. In fact, the window (−5,+5) produces returns that stand at 1.6%, which is the greatest abnormal return over the five days around the publication date. The economic impact of a cumulative return of 1.6% in eleven days is tantamount to annual returns of 69.33%. Considering that the average market value of the sample is €17,494 million, it represents an increase of €279 million for the sample stocks on the period (−5,+5). The regression analysis shows that the coefficients of the variable “co-branding” are positive and significant, which supports the hypothesis that co-branding presents higher abnormal returns than joint promotion. However, no differential effect are found between B to B versus B to C paradigms. The results obtained present an increase in the variance of the share prices after the alliance announcement date, which supports the hypothesis that the variance of the company stock returns is positively associated to announcements of brand alliances. Research Implications: The key implication of the measurement of the market value of brand alliances is that research should be reoriented toward a better understanding of the role of marketing in the value creation of a company. Instead of just concentrating on marketing research into consumer behavior, more emphasis should be given to the core company processes that create shareholder value. Practical Implications: The managerial implications of the specific results obtained are the following: the result that companies increase their market value when they implement brand alliance strategies, leads to a better ken of the way alliance activities can be managed when dealing with other organizations. In this way, finding a partner to form a brand alliance with could be a useful objective in terms of firm performance. Moreover, the results show that co-branding presents higher abnormal returns than joint promotion, which suggests that co-branding is the most valuable strategic decision (or long-term decision) for companies, as it implies the simultaneous participation of two or more brands in a single product. In this way, deciding on whether a short- or long-term branding strategy is pursued turns to be fundamental. Originality/Value/Contribution of the paper: The literature has analyzed the consequences of brand alliance, which looks at each partner’s brand attitude after the alliance, the brand equity of the constituent brands after the alliance, and the impact of the allied brand on the evaluation of the host brand. These studies have focused on the area of consumer behavior; that is, by measuring consumers´ attitudes and evaluation. Still, the measurement of dimensions reflecting the other side of the relationship, i.e. the firm, via brand image and equity is critical. Nevertheless, the examination of the impact of brand alliances on the partner company performance and risk has received little attention, despite the fact that “brand perceptions of companies’ products spill over to investment decisions in the market for companies’ stock”. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Brand alliances; co-branding; joint-promotion; stock market response; uncertainty","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85106229558"

Secondly, from a large panel of macroeconomic series we identify the most significant indicator variables for inflation expectations using the elastic net modification of the LASSO regression. Finally, we measure partial contributions of individual indicator variables to the changes in inflation expectations. Our findings reveal that across horizons considered inflation expectations are correlated to the measures of current inflation of the overall price level and price level of services, the unemployment rate, and the Euro exchange rate. The identified indicators provide a useful information about the evolution of inflation expectations with different intensities at different horizons. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Affine term structure models; Elastic net regularisation; Inflation dynamics; Inflation expectations; Inflation linked swap rates; Macroeconomic determinants","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85105241044"

Our aim is to test whether the Fama-French five-factor model augmented with a default risk factor improves the predictability of returns of portfolios sorted on the firm’s characteristics as well as on industry. The default risk factor is constructed by estimating the probability of default using a hybrid version of dynamic panel probit and artificial neural network (ANN) to proxy default risk. This study also provides evidence on the temporal stability of risk premiums obtained using the Fama-MacBeth approach. Using a sample of 3,806 firm-year observations on non-financial listed companies of Pakistan over 2006–2015 we found that the augmented model performed better when tested across size-investment-default sorted portfolios. The investment factor contains some default-related information, but default risk is independently priced and bears a significantly positive risk premium. The risk premiums are also found temporally stable over the full sample and more recent sample period 2010–2015 as evidence by the Fama-MacBeth regressions. The finding suggests that the default risk factor is not a useless factor and due to mispricing, default risk anomaly prevails in the Pakistani equity market. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Asset Pricing; Default Risk; Emerging Market; Fama-French Five-Factor Model","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85102257576"

This approach facilitates the optimization of operational policies but is at odds with empirical facts about energy and commodity prices, which are better captured by non-Gaussian processes. We discuss this alternative modeling strategy, focusing on Lévy processes. As an illustration, we show that it substantially increases the optimal policy value in a simplified merchant natural gas storage setting. Further, we highlight potential implications of using this approach to formulate realistic energy and commodity operations models. Our work has broader relevance for modeling the dynamics of both other market variables and operational quantities, such as exchange rates and demand forecasts.

The measures are based on nonparametric quantile regressions and defined as logarithmic functions of restricted and unrestricted expectations of quantile check loss functions. They can consistently be estimated by replacing the unknown expectations of check loss functions by their nonparametric kernel estimates. We derive a Bahadur-type representation for the nonparametric estimator of the measures. We establish the asymptotic distribution of this estimator, which can be used to build tests for the statistical significance of the measures. Thereafter, we show the validity of a smoothed local bootstrap that can be used in finite-sample settings to perform statistical tests. A Monte Carlo simulation study reveals that the bootstrap-based test has a good finite-sample size and power properties for a variety of data-generating processes and different sample sizes. Finally, we provide an empirical application to illustrate the usefulness of measuring Granger causality in quantiles. We quantify the degree of predictability of the quantiles of equity risk premium using the variance risk premium, unemployment rate, inflation, and the effective federal funds rate. The empirical results show that the variance risk premium and effective federal funds rate have a strong predictive power for predicting the risk premium when compared to that of the predictive power of the other two macro variables. In particular, the variance risk premium is able to predict the center, lower, and upper quantiles of the distribution of the risk premium; however, the effective federal funds rate predicts only the lower and upper quantiles. Nevertheless, unemployment and inflation rates have no effect on the risk premium. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Conditional quantiles; Local linear estimator; Measures of Granger causality; Smoothed local bootstrap","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85083679836"

However, official national statistics on suicide rates are delayed by 1 to 2 years, hampering evidence-based public health planning and decision-making. Objective: To estimate weekly suicide fatalities in the US in near real time. Design, Setting, and Participants: This cross-sectional national study used a machine learning pipeline to combine signals from several streams of real-time information to estimate weekly suicide fatalities in the US in near real time. This 2-phase approach first fits optimal machine learning models to each individual data stream and subsequently combines predictions made from each data stream via an artificial neural network. National-level US administrative data on suicide deaths, health services, and economic, meteorological, and online data were variously obtained from 2014 to 2017. Data were analyzed from January 1, 2014, to December 31, 2017. Exposures: Longitudinal data on suicide-related exposures were obtained from multiple, heterogeneous streams: emergency department visits for suicide ideation and attempts collected via the National Syndromic Surveillance Program (2015-2017); calls to the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline (2014-2017); calls to US poison control centers for intentional self-harm (2014-2017); consumer price index and seasonality-adjusted unemployment rate, hourly earnings, home price index, and 3-month and 10-year yield curves from the Federal Reserve Economic Data (2014-2017); weekly daylight hours (2014-2017); Google and YouTube search trends related to suicide (2014-2017); and public posts on suicide on Reddit (2314533 posts), Twitter (9327472 tweets; 2015-2017), and Tumblr (1670378 posts; 2014-2017). Main Outcomes and Measures: Weekly estimates of suicide fatalities in the US were obtained through a machine learning pipeline that integrated the above data sources. Estimates were compared statistically with actual fatalities recorded by the National Vital Statistics System. Results: Combining information from multiple data streams, the machine learning method yielded estimates of weekly suicide deaths with high correlation to actual counts and trends (Pearson correlation, 0.811; P <.001), while estimating annual suicide rates with low error (0.55%). Conclusions and Relevance: The proposed ensemble machine learning framework reduces the error for annual suicide rate estimation to less than one-tenth of that of current forecasting approaches that use only historical information on suicide deaths. These findings establish a novel approach for tracking suicide fatalities in near real time and provide the potential for an effective public health response such as supporting budgetary decisions or deploying interventions. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","","adult; Article; artificial neural network; automutilation; consumer; controlled study; correlation coefficient; cost; cross-sectional study; deep neural network; economic aspect; emergency ward; fatality; female; health service; human; linear regression analysis; machine learning; major clinical study; male; meteorology; observational study; poison center; prediction; priority journal; search engine; seasonal variation; social media; suicidal ideation; suicide; support vector machine; trend study; unemployment; United States; young adult; epidemiology; forecasting; health survey; hospital emergency service; information retrieval; procedures; public health; Cross-Sectional Studies; Emergency Service, Hospital; Forecasting; Humans; Information Storage and Retrieval; Machine Learning; Public Health; Public Health Surveillance; Suicide","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85099076517"

Another novel element of the work is the use of partial dependency graphs (PDP) and individual conditional expectation curves (ICES) to interpret the results that allow observing for specific values how the banking variables vary, when the macro-financial variables vary. It is concluded that the most determining variables to predict bank solvency in the United States are interest rates, specifically the mortgage rate and the 5 and 10-year interest rates of treasury bonds, reducing solvency as these rates increase. For delinquency, the most important variable is the unemployment rate in the forecast.

Stock Exchange Thailand (SET) indexes was used as a case study for this work. The predictors used in this paper are: borrowing rate: BR, policy rate: PR, treasury bill rate: TBR, government bond yield: GBYLT, minimum overdraft rate: MOR, minimum loan rate: MLR, minimum retail rate: MRR, discount rate: DISR, savings rate: SAVER, deposit rate: DEPR and lending rate: LENDR. These factors are considered as the most important monetary policy tools from Bank of Thailand. The empirical results demonstrated that each SET index sector responses to those economic variables differently. Some of them are not actually related for specific point of time; some other times, however, they affect SET indexes. Filtered time-varying parameters allow us to indicate the relationship between stock price return and interest rates. According to statistical evidence, we found that the relationship is as of the time-varying characteristic and is unable to absolute identify whether it is positively or negatively related to stock price return for each sector. The impact of a sector on SET indexes depends on a period of time and can also be considered by using seasoning parameters. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Bayesian method; Dynamic model averaging; Kalman filter; posterior inclusion probability; SET indexes; State-space model; stock exchange; Time-varying system","Bayesian networks; Dynamic models; Kalman filters; State space methods; Time varying systems; Bayesian methods; Inclusion probability; Model averaging; SET indexes; State - space models; Stock exchange; Financial markets","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85082804266"

The findings show that the new aligned sentiment index has much greater predictive power than the original principal component analysis (PCA)-based sentiment index both in- and out-of-sample.

Artificial intelligence in finance and treasury is thus most analogous to the complexity of a human nervous system as it encompasses far more than the automation of tasks. Similar to the human nervous system, AI systems in finance/treasury must manage data quickly and accurately, including the capture and classification of data and its integration into larger datasets.

However, no overall distinguished methods have been used in predicting bond ratings. Moreover, recent studies have suggested ensembles of classifiers that may be used in bond rating prediction. This article proposes an improved machine learning aimed to predict the rating of financial bonds. We empirically compare the classifiers ranging from logistic regression and discriminant analysis to nonparametric classifiers, such as support vector machine, neural networks, the cost-sensitive decision tree algorithm and deep neural networks.

Our diffusion indexes are constructed using principal component analysis with both targeted and untargeted predictors, with targeting done using the lasso and elastic net. Our findings can be summarized as follows. First, the marginal predictive content of real-time diffusion indexes is significant for the preponderance of the individual models that we examine. The exception to this finding is the post “Great Recession” period. Second, forecast combinations that include only yield variables result in our most accurate predictions, for most sample periods and maturities. In this case, diffusion indexes do not have marginal predictive content for yields and do not seem to reflect unspanned risks. This points to the continuing usefulness of DNS and NSS models that are purely yield driven. Finally, we find that the use of fully revised macroeconomic data may have an important confounding effect upon results obtained when forecasting yields, as prior research has indicated that diffusion indexes are often useful for predicting yields when constructed using fully revised data, regardless of whether forecast combination is used, or not. Nevertheless, our findings also underscore the potential importance of using machine learning, data reduction, and shrinkage methods in contexts such as term structure modeling. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85087814355"

More specifically, we propose a sequential autoencoder (SAE) to process the sequential data, extract and decode the low-dimensional representations and generate the milk yield sequences. The SAE is compared with a more traditional multilayer perceptron model (MLP) which uses herd and parity information and lagged milk yields as input. Results show that incorporating the recorded daily milk yields, lactation number, herd statistics as well as reproduction and health events the cow encountered during the lactation cycle results in the most qualitative latent representations. Moreover, by leveraging these low-dimensional encodings, the SAE reconstructed the entire milk yield curve with a higher accuracy than the MLP. Hence, we present a framework that is able to infer missing milk yields along the entire lactation curve which facilitates selection and culling decisions as well as the estimation of future earnings and costs.

In this paper, a new multi-objective game theory-based model is developed to increase the security of cash-in-transit. For this purpose and in order to reduce the transportation costs, a bi-objective vehicle routing problem with time window is developed where the risk of transfers (including armed robbers attack and theft) and the distance traveled by vehicles are minimized. In order to better estimate the robber's performance, the probability of robber's ambush is calculated by the game theory approach, in such a way that a two-player, zero-sum game is played between the robber and the cash carrier. The probability of theft success is also estimated in the proposed approach through a multiple-criteria decision-making and in order to be further representative of real-life situations. A periodic review is also added to the proposed model to increase the cash transport security in which the previously used links would enjoy less chance of choosing in the current period. Moreover, a new multi-objective hybrid genetic algorithm incorporated with a number of new heuristics and operators is developed to tackle the proposed model. The efficiency and effectiveness of the algorithm are examined through several standard data sets, and the results indicate the effectiveness of the proposed solution algorithm. The wide applicability of our proposed approach in real-life situations is examined with a real case study as well. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Cash-in-transit; Game theory; Hybrid genetic algorithm; Risk minimization; Vehicle routing problem with time window","Crime; Decision making; Genetic algorithms; Vehicle routing; Vehicles; Hybrid genetic algorithms; Multi-objective evolutionary; Multi-objective games; Multiple criteria decision making; Solution algorithms; Transport security; Transportation cost; Vehicle routing problem with time windows; Game theory","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85084485975"

As a consequence of this disalignment, the two measures no longer share the same nullset, thus distorting the investors’ risk premium and the validity of the pricing measure.

A feed-forward neural network trained with the extreme learning machine algorithm is used as the initial implementation of the forecasting model. The predictive strategy and the forecasting model only need information available from electricity derivatives and spot markets at the time of negotiation. In this paper, the predictive trading strategy has been applied successfully to the Iberian Electricity Market (MIBEL). The forecasting model was applied for the six types of maturities available for monthly futures in the MIBEL, from 1 to 6 months ahead. The forecasting model was trained with MIBEL price data corresponding to 44 months and the performances of the forecasting model and of the predictive strategy were tested with data corresponding to a further 12 months. Furthermore, a simpler forecasting model and three benchmark trading strategies are also presented and evaluated using the Risk Premium in the testing period, for comparative purposes.

Analysis of the interconnectedÂness between assets and factors shows that their relaÂtionship is strong. The authors compare the allocation techniques, considering centrality and hierarchal-based networks. They demonstrate the advantages of graph theory to explain the advantages to portfolio manageÂment and the dynamic nature of assets and factors with their ""importance score."" They find that asset allocaÂtion can be efficiently derived using directed networks, dynamically driven by both US Treasuries and curÂrency returns with significant centrality scores. AlterÂnatively, the inverse variance weight estimation and correlation-based networks generate factor allocation with favorable risk-return parameters. Furthermore, factor allocation is driven mostly by the importance scores of the Fama-French-Carhart factors: SMB, HML, CMA, RMW, and MOM. The authors confirm previous results and argue that both factors and assets are interconnected with different value and momentum factors. Therefore, a blended strategy comprising factors and assets can be defensible for investors. As argued in previous research, factors are much more overcrowded than assets. Therefore, the centrality scores help to identify the crowded expoÂsure and build diversified allocation. The authors run LASSO regressions and show how the network-based allocation can be implemented using machine learning. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Factor-based models; Portfolio construction; Portfolio theory","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85088367857"

This work uses fuzzy inference system (FIS) and strongly typed genetic programming (STGP) to generate trading rules for the US stock market, a framework that we call FISTGP. The two embedded models have not been widely evaluated in financial applications, and according to the literature, their combination could improve forecasting performance. The fitness function used to train the STGP model is based on accuracy, optimizing the buy and sell signals, taking a different approach to the classic optimization of return–risk ratio. The rules are generated in a FIS framework, and the final signal depends on the amount of information that the investor relies on. The model is suited to each investor as a recommendation of when to change portfolio composition according to his or her particular criteria. Ternary rules are generated based on an economic interpretation, considering the risk-free rate as a part of more demanding rules. The model is applied to 90 of the most traded and active stocks in the US stock market. This approach generates important recommendations and delivers useful information to investors. The results show that the proposed model outperforms the Buy and Hold (B&H) strategy by 28.62% in the test period, considering excesses of return, with almost the same risk (1.28% higher).

The service life of marine assets is heavily influenced by the involvement of numerous material degradation processes (such as fatigue cracking, corrosion and pitting) as well as environmental stresses that vary with geographic locations and climatic factors. The composition of seawater constituents (e.g. dissolved oxygen, salinity, temperature content, etc.) is one of the major influencing factors in degradation of marine assets. Improving the efficiency and effectiveness of maintenance management strategies can have a significant impact on operational availability and reliability of marine assets. Many research studies have been conducted over the past few decades to predict the degradation behaviour of marine structures operating under different environmental conditions. The utilisation of structural degradation data – particularly on marine corrosion – can be very useful in developing a reliable, risk-free and cost-effective maintenance strategy. This paper presents an overview of the state-of-the-art and future trends in asset maintenance management strategies applied to corroded steel structures in extreme marine environments. The corrosion prediction models as well as industry best practices on maintenance of marine steel structures are extensively reviewed and analysed. Furthermore, some applications of advanced technologies such as computerized maintenance management system (CMMS), artificial intelligence (AI) and Bayesian network (BN) are discussed. Our review reveals that there are significant variations in corrosion behaviour of marine steel structures and their industrial maintenance practices from one climatic condition to another. This has been found to be largely attributed to variation in seawater composition/characteristics and their complex mutual relationships. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Degradation; Extreme climatic conditions; Maintenance management; Marine corrosion; Steel structures","Bayesian networks; Corrosive effects; Cost effectiveness; Degradation; Dissolved oxygen; Environmental management; Maintenance; Marine engineering; Offshore oil well production; Offshore oil wells; Offshore structures; Steel corrosion; Steel structures; Asset maintenance management; Climatic conditions; Computerized maintenance management system; Environmental conditions; Maintenance management; Marine corrosion; Offshore renewable energies; Operational availability; Seawater corrosion; artificial intelligence; corrosion; degradation; efficiency measurement; marine environment; offshore structure; steel structure; strategic approach","Review","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85078962228"

So far, the literature has analyzed only absolute measures of investment attractiveness as determinants of cross-border investment flows. Design/methodology/approach: The empirical study uses a classic ordinary least squares estimation for a European panel data set containing 28 cities in 18 countries, with quarterly observations from Q1/2008 to Q3/2018. After controlling for empirically proven explanatory covariates, the model is extended by the new relative measurement based on relative yields/cap rates and relative risk premia. Additionally, the study applies a generalized additive mixed model (GAMM) to investigate a potentially nonlinear relationship. Findings: The study finds on average a ceteris paribus, statistically significant lagged influence of the proxy for relative attractiveness. Nonetheless, a differentiation is needed; relative risk premia are statistically significant, whereas relative yields are not. Moreover, the GAMM confirms a nonlinear relationship for relative risk premia and cross-border transaction volumes. Practical implications: The results are of interest for both academia and market participants as a means of explaining cross-border capital flows. The existing knowledge on determinants is expanded by relative market attractiveness, as well as an awareness of nonlinear relationships. Both insights help to comprehend the underlying transaction dynamics in commercial real estate markets. Originality/value: Whereas the existing body of literature focuses on absolute attractiveness to explain cross-border transaction activity, this study introduces relative attractiveness as an explanatory variable. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Cross-border real estate investment; Direct property investment; European real estate; Nonlinear regression; Panel data","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85078991288"

Our estimation shows that indeed the link is highly nonlinear and helps to identify the NFA position where the nonlinearity kicks in at approximately-70% to-75% of GDP. We also provide a proper calibration of the risk premium-NFA relationship which can be used in DSGE models and demonstrate that its slope matters significantly for economic dynamics in such a model. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Open Economy DSGE Model; PSTR Model; Risk Premium","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85052611952"

Subsequently, whether traditional economical models can ever outperform the random walk in forecasting out-of-sample exchange rates has received scholarly attention. Recently, a combination of fundamental models with machine learning methodologies was found to outcompete the predictability of random walk (Amat et al. 2018). This paper focuses on combining modern machine learning methodologies with traditional economic models and examines whether such combinations can outperform the prediction performance of random walk without drift. More specifically, this paper applies the random forest, support vector machine, and neural network models to four fundamental theories (uncovered interest rate parity, purchase power parity, the monetary model, and the Taylor rule models). We performed a thorough robustness check using six government bonds with different maturities and four price indexes, which demonstrated the superior performance of fundamental models combined with modern machine learning in predicting future exchange rates in comparison with the results of random walk. These results were examined using a root mean squared error (RMSE) and a Diebold–Mariano (DM) test. The main findings are as follows. First, when comparing the performance of fundamental models combined with machine learning with the performance of random walk, the RMSE results show that the fundamental models with machine learning outperform the random walk. In the DM test, the results are mixed as most of the results show significantly different predictive accuracies compared with the random walk. Second, when comparing the performance of fundamental models combined with machine learning, the models using the producer price index (PPI) consistently show good predictability. Meanwhile, the consumer price index (CPI) appears to be comparatively poor in predicting exchange rate, based on its poor results in the RMSE test and the DM test. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","exchange rates; fundamentals; neural network; prediction; random forest; support vector machine","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85091877651"

Several recent empirical studies have considered a large set of macroeconomic predictors and technical indicators with the goal of forecasting the S&P 500 equity risk premium. To illustrate the merit of the proposed approach, we extend the mean-based equity premium forecasting into the conditional quantile context. The application offers three main findings. First, combining parametric and non-parametric approaches adds quantile forecast accuracy over and above the constituent methods. Second, a handful of macroeconomic predictors are found to have systematic forecasting power.

Specifically, we model the distribution of the yield curve factors according to an infinite Markov mixture (iMM). The model allows for time variation in the mean and covariance matrix of factors in a discrete manner, as opposed to continuous changes in these parameters such as the Time Varying Parameter (TVP) models. Estimating the number of regimes using the iMM structure endogenously leads to an adaptive process that can generate newly emerging regimes over time in response to changing economic conditions in addition to existing regimes. The potential of the proposed framework is examined using US bond yields data. The semiparametric structure of the factors can handle various forms of non-normalities including fat tails and nonlinear dependence between factors using a unified approach by generating new clusters capturing these specific characteristics. We document that modeling parameter changes in a discrete manner increases the model fit as well as forecasting performance at both short and long horizons relative to models with fixed parameters as well as the TVP model with continuous parameter changes. This is mainly due to fact that the discrete changes in parameters suit the typical low frequency monthly bond yields data characteristics better. © 2019 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Bayesian inference; Dirichlet process mixture; dynamic factor model; Nelson-Siegel model; yield curve","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85075741011"

This means that the key factor that influences price changes is usually based on regulation and legislative dynamics. Additionally, where ratemaking is risk based, analysis has in most cases focused on internal historical data or claims history, particularly in the sub Saharran Africa. These policy regimes have led to unfair price distortions among policyholders and have increased risk of portfolios for most insurance companies. In this study we consider geographical location risk that influence auto-insurance claim process for an insurance company. The study develops a Markov-modulated tree-based gradient boosting (MMGB) model for pricing auto-insurance premiums. The Markov-modulated tree-based gradient boosting model is a Tweedie general linear model (GLM) based pricing algorithm with a compound Poisson-Gamma distribution whose rate varies according to accident risk in a Markovian process. Thus, the study extends the existing premium pricing framework by integrating a geographical location risk factor into the main pricing framework. The study applies the model to a motor insurance data set from Ghana. The results show that the proposed method is superior to other competing models because it generates relatively fair premium predictions for the non-life auto-insurance companies, helping to mitigate more the insured risk for the firm and the industry. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Auto-insurance models; gradient boosting; Markov-modulated pricing; risk premium pricing in Ghana","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85085768703"

First uncertainty is transformed into a risk measure by extracting damage distribution means and variances from an ensemble of socio economic and climate change scenarios. Then a risk premium is computed under different degrees of risk aversion, quantifying what society would be willing to pay to insure against the uncertainty of the damages. Our estimates show that the premium for the risk is a potentially significant addition to the “standard average damage”, but highly sensitive to the attitudes toward risk. In the last research phase, the risk premium is incorporated into the climate change damage function of a widely used IAM which shows, consequently, a substantial increase in both mitigation and adaptation efforts, reflecting a more precautionary attitude by the social planner. Interestingly, adaptation is stimulated more than mitigation in the first half of this century, while the situation reverses afterwards. © 2019 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Adaptation; Climate change damages; Mitigation; Risk; Uncertainty","Climate models; Damage detection; Risk assessment; Risk perception; Risks; Adaptation; Climate change scenarios; Damage distribution; Damage functions; Integrated assessment models; Mitigation; Social planners; Uncertainty; Climate change","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85075175087"

A common tool used in the relevant forecasting literature is the term spread of Treasury bond yields. In this paper, we decompose the term spread into an expectation and a term premium component and evaluate the informational content of each component in forecasting the GDP growth rate and inflation in various forecasting horizons. In doing so, we employ alternative decomposition procedures and introduce the Support Vector Regression (SVR) methodology from the field of Machine Learning, coupled with linear and non-linear kernels as a novel forecasting method in the field. Using rolling windows in producing point and conditional probability distribution forecasts we find that neither the term spread, nor its decomposition components possess the ability to accurately forecast output growth or inflation. Our findings extend the existing literature, since they are focused on an explicit out-of-sample evaluation in contrast to most existing empirical studies that produce only in-sample forecasts. To strengthen our findings, we also consider several control variables suggested in the relevant literature without significant qualitative differences from the initial results. The main innovation of our approach stems from the use of the non-linear Support Vectors Machine methodology, that is introduced for the first time in this line of research for forecasting out-of-sample. © 2019 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Forecasting; GDP; Inflation; Support Vector Machines; Term Premium","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85071871619"

This article presents evidence that LASSO identifies significant predictors of the returns of an individual industry among its interdependent industries. The results indicate cross-predictability of industry return by showing a significant relation between an industry's returns and the lagged returns of its LASSO-selected trade partners. The study finds that industries that are more central in the input-output network have a greater effect in predicting related industry return. It also computes out of sample (2011-2016) the mean return forecasts of the portfolio of industries based on the predictability effect of the lagged returns of trade partners. The self-financing trading strategy of buying (selling) a high (low) portfolio based on related industry lagged returns yields about 10.44 percent annual excess return (0.83 percent monthly), with an annual Sharpe ratio of about 0.86.

While these techniques, such as Deep Belief Networks or Random Forests, are becoming more and more popular on the market, the academic literature is relatively sparse. Through a series of applications involving hundreds of variables/predictors and stocks, this article presents some of the state-of-the-art techniques and how they can be implemented to manage a long-short portfolio. Numerous practical and empirical issues are developed. One of the main questions beyond big data use is the value of information. Does an increase in the number of predictors improve the portfolio performance? Which features are the most important? A large number of predictors means, potentially, a high level of noise. How do the algorithms manage this? This article develops an application using a 22-year trading period, up to 300 U.S. large caps and around 600 predictors. The empirical results underline the ability of these techniques to generate useful trading signals for portfolios with important turnovers and short holding periods (one or five days). Positive excess returns are reported between 1993 and 2008. They are strongly reduced after accounting for transaction costs and traditional risk factors. When these machine learning tools were readily available in the market, excess returns turned into the negative in most recent times.

Following this strand of literature, this paper aims to focus on the causality link between political shocks and their impacts on emerging stock markets. Design/methodology/approach: This paper highlights an innovative counterfactual model for political risk assessment. Based on a natural experiment, i.e. the Taiwan Strait Crisis in 1995-1996, this study utilizes one data-driven approach, e.g. the synthetic control methods (SCMs), to estimate causal impact of this political shock on Taiwan’s stock market. Findings: Major findings in this study are consistent with existing literature on the price of political risk, e.g. political uncertainty commands a risk premium. The SCM estimations suggest that Taiwan’s stock prices dramatically underperformed its newly industrialized peers and other developed markets during the crisis. The SCM results are statistically significant and robust to various cross-validation tests. Research limitations/implications: Findings in this study indicate that political risks could generate enormous impacts on emerging financial markets. In particular, political uncertainty following new geopolitical dynamics requires proper identification and assessment. Originality/value: To the author’s knowledge, this paper is the first rigorous counterfactual study to the causality relationship between political uncertainty and stock prices in emerging markets. This paper is distinct from previous studies in applying a data-driven approach to combine the features of learning from others (cross-sectional) and learning from the past (time series). © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Forecasting and simulation; International finance","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85066972845"

In contrast to the traditional linear regression scheme that is usually used to describe the relationship between the stock forward return and company characteristics, the field of finance has experienced the rapid development of tree-based algorithms and neural network paradigms when illustrating complex stock dynamics. These nonlinear methods have proved to be effective in predicting stock prices and selecting stocks that can outperform the general market. This article implements and evaluates the robustness of the random forest (RF) model in the context of the stock selection strategy. The model is trained for stocks in the Chinese stock market, and two types of feature spaces, fundamental/technical feature space and pure momentum feature space, are adopted to forecast the price trend in the long run and the short run, respectively. It is evidenced that both feature paradigms have led to remarkable excess returns during the past five out-of-sample period years, with the Sharpe ratios calculated to be 2.75 and 5 for the portfolio net value of the multi-factor space strategy and momentum space strategy, respectively. Although the excess return has weakened in recent years with respect to the multi-factor strategy, our findings point to a less efficient market that is far from equilibrium. © 2019 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Computer science; Economics; Excess return; Finance; Machine learning; Random forests; Stock selection","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85070685998"

However, few attentions were paid on this topic in China. This essay regards Chinese bond market as a complex system and constructs bond indices for China with the bottom-up approach. The authors use the data of 3,205 non-financial corporate bonds from February 2010 to October 2017 and construct a new spread noted as the PE_SOE spread. The authors find that the PE_SOE spread has a negative impact on economic activities and has the best predictive ability at short-run forecasting horizons, owing to the institutional superiority of the state-owned enterprises in China. The Treasury bond yields are found to have the best predictive ability at long-run horizons. Both spread shock and Treasury yield shock could lead to deflation and declines in economic activities, and the Treasury yield shock has a more severe and persistent impact on the economy due to the financial accelerator mechanism. PE_SOE spread is proved to be a better indicator for Chinese corporate bond market and can be widely used not only in future Chinese economic studies, but also for Chinese government’s macroeconomic monitoring and warning. © 2019 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Chinese bond market; corporate bond spreads; credit spreads; financial accelerator; private enterprises; state-owned enterprises","Commerce; Financial markets; Corporate bond; Credit spread; Financial accelerators; Private enterprise; State owned enterprise; Economic and social effects","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85070354232"

The authors also find the answer to whether the “price pressure hypothesis” would hold true for the Indian stock market. Design/methodology/approach: The authors employ a more recent fully balanced panel data for the period from July 2012 to Jun 2017 (260 weeks) of observations for companies of NIFTY 50 of the National Stock Exchange in the Indian stock market. The authors are motivated by Tetlock (2007) and Bijl et al. (2016) to employ regression approach of econometric estimation. Findings: The authors find that high Google search volumes lead to positive returns. More precisely, the high Google search volumes predict positive and significant returns in the subsequent fourth and fifth weeks. The GSVI performs as an useful predictor of the direction as well as the magnitude of the excess returns. The higher quantiles of the GSVI have corresponding higher excess returns. The authors notice that the domestic investor searches are correlated with higher excess returns than the worldwide investor searches. The findings imply that the signals from the search volume data could be of help in the construction of profitable trading strategies. Originality/value: To the best of the authors knowledge, no paper has examined the relationship between Google search intensity and stock-trading behavior in the Indian stock market. The authors use a more recent data for the period from 2012 to 2017 to investigate whether search query data on company names can be used to predict weekly stock returns for individual firms. This study complements the prior studies by investigating the relationship between search intensity and stock-trading behavior in the Indian stock market. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Google searches; Predictability; Stock returns","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85066902963"

This paper is the first comprehensive study using artificial neural networks in the context of yield curve forecasting. Specifically, two models were used for forecasting the European yield curve: multivariate linear regression and multilayer perceptron (MLP), at five forecasting horizons, from next day to 20 days ahead. Five variants of the MLP were analysed with different sets of features: target to predict (univariate); the most relevant features; all generated features; and the former two incorporating synthetic data generated by the linear regression model. Additionally, two different techniques of multitask learning were employed: simultaneous modelling and transformation into multiple single task learning. The results show that considering all forecasting horizons, the MLP using the most relevant features achieved the best results and the addition of synthetic data tends to improve accuracy. Furthermore, different targets and forecasting horizons resulted in different relevant features, reinforcing the importance of custom-built models. In the two multitask learning methodologies no clear differentiation could be demonstrated, and several explaining factors are identified. Overall, the outcome is very encouraging for the development of better forecasting systems for fixed income markets. © 2018 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Bond market; Machine learning; Multitask learning; Neural network; Yield curve forecasting; Yield forecasting","Commerce; Electronic trading; Financial markets; Learning algorithms; Learning systems; Linear regression; Neural networks; Fixed-income market; Linear regression models; Multi layer perceptron; Multitask learning; Multivariate linear regressions; Single task learning; Yield curve; Yield forecasting; Forecasting","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85056279875"

In this paper, we propose a parametric factor model for the term structure of mortality where multiple factors are designed to influence the age groups differently via parametric loading functions. We identify four different factors: a factor common for all age groups, factors for infant and adult mortality, and a factor for the “accident hump” that primarily affects mortality of relatively young adults and late teenagers. Since the factors are identified via restrictions on the loading functions, the factors are not designed to be orthogonal but can be dependent and can possibly cointegrate when the factors have unit roots. We suggest two estimation procedures similar to the estimation of the dynamic Nelson–Siegel term structure model. First, a two-step nonlinear least squares procedure based on cross-section regressions together with a separate model to estimate the dynamics of the factors. Second, we suggest a fully specified model estimated by maximum likelihood via the Kalman filter recursions after the model is put on state space form. We demonstrate the methodology for US and French mortality data. We find that the model provides a good fit of the relevant factors and, in a forecast comparison with a range of benchmark models, it is found that, especially for longer horizons, variants of the parametric factor model have excellent forecast performance. © 2019 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Cointegration; Factor modelling; Mortality forecasting; Term structure of mortality","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85069524567"

We look at a large panel of 25 European countries between 1992 and 2015. By means panel and time-series approaches, we find that lower short-term interest rates and better fiscal institutions tend to lower bond yields. The better the economic and fiscal outlooks going forward, the lower the yields demanded in international markets. Timing also matters: investors seem to pay more attention to forecasts the shorter the forecast horizon, and they started carrying more weight since the Global Financial Crisis. Finally, the impact of yields' determinants is different across countries, being more prominent in those characterized by economic hardship conditions (Greece, Ireland, Spain, and Portugal).

The law governing trustees, investment advisers, broker–dealers, 401(k) plan managers, and other investment fiduciaries has evolved to push them gently toward this consensus. But these laws still provide broad scope for fiduciaries to recommend that clients invest instead in specific assets that they believe will produce “alpha” by outperforming the market. Seeking alpha comes at a cost, however, in giving up some of the benefits of the well-diversified, low-cost, appropriate-risk baseline. Too little attention has been given in fiduciary law to this tradeoff and, thus, to when seeking alpha is prudent and beneficial for savers, and when it is not. This Article begins to fill that gap by making two contributions. First, we provide the first benchmark estimates of how much alpha is required before ordinary investors would be better off departing from the consensus. For example, we estimate that a person of average risk aversion would annually need to beat the market by (i.e., obtain alpha of) between 6% and 15% before being willing to entirely forego the benefits of diversification and hold an individual stock (and that during a financial crisis such a person would need an annual alpha between 9% and 18%). Second, we consider the implications of our results for the various branches of law governing investment fiduciaries. We propose generally that fiduciaries should prudently weigh these alpha tradeoffs, and then should explain them to their clients before recommending (or executing) investments that deviate from the low-cost, well-diversified, age-appropriate exposure standard. We argue that through new technology, this kind of information can be given to retirement savers and others at quite low cost. Our results also have a variety of more specific applications. For example, our work shows that the value of diversification increases during periods of market upheaval, and therefore the duty of trustees to diversify personal trusts and employee retirement plans should likewise strengthen during such periods. © 2019 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85070447351"

The Random Forest (RF) model, the Long Short-Term Memory network (LSTM) model, and the Support Vector Regression (SVR) model are used to predict 50 ETF price. Firstly, the original quantitative investment strategy is taken as the research object, and the 15 min trading frequency, which is more in line with the actual trading situation, is used, and then the Delta hedging concept of the options is introduced to control the risk of the quantitative investment strategy, to achieve the 15 min hedging strategy. Secondly, the final transaction price, buy price, highest price, lowest price, volume, historical volatility, and the implied volatility of the time segment marked with 50 ETF are the seven key factors affecting the price of 50 ETF. Then, two different types of LSTM-SVR models, LSTM-SVR I and LSTM-SVR II, are used to predict the final transaction price of the 50 ETF in the next time segment. In LSTM-SVR I model, the output of LSTM and seven key factors are combined as the input of SVR model. In LSTM-SVR II model, the hidden state vectors of LSTM and seven key factors are combined as the inputs of the SVR model. The results of the two LSTM-SVR models are compared with each other, and the better one is applied to the trading strategy. Finally, the benefit of the deep learning-based quantitative investment strategy, the resilience, and the maximum drawdown are used as indicators to judge the pros and cons of the research results. The accuracy and deviations of the LSTM-SVR prediction models are compared with those of the LSTM model and those of the RF model. The experimental results show that the quantitative investment strategy based on deep learning has higher returns than the traditional quantitative investment strategy, the yield curve is more stable, and the anti-fall performance is better. © 2019 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Deep learning; Long short-term memory network; Options prediction; Quantitative investment strategy; Random forest; Support vector regression","Brain; Commerce; Decision trees; Deep learning; Forecasting; Investments; Strategic planning; Hedging strategies; Implied volatility; Investment strategy; Random forests; Short term memory; Support vector regression (SVR); Trading strategies; Transaction price; Long short-term memory","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85061984447"

For illustration, we analyse spot and future prices from the EEX using the new Bayesian method and provide estimates for the risk premium together with credibility regions. © 2019 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","CARMA model; Electricity prices; Futures prices; Markov chain Monte Carlo; Seasonality; Stable density approximation; α -Stable process","Bayesian networks; Electronic trading; Markov processes; Stability criteria; Density approximations; Electricity prices; Futures prices; Markov Chain Monte-Carlo; Seasonality; Stable process; Costs; Bayesian analysis; electricity generation; estimation method; Markov chain; Monte Carlo analysis; price dynamics; seasonality","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85057586272"

A new CDS-based approach to estimate current expected credit loss is proposed for low default portfolios, containing credit exposures to corporate issuers covered by publicly traded CDS contracts. First, a fraction of CDS spread related to a pure default compensation for different CDS maturities is assessed. Our results contrast with previous research. Second, based on the obtained historical weights of the default risk premium, a forward-looking term structure of the probabilities of default implied by the current CDS quotes is derived. The proposed approach covers both investment and noninvestment grade debt. The resulting framework is applied to a sample of corporate bonds. The developed methodology provides a useful tool, on one hand, for credit risk managers and balance-sheet preparers and, on the other hand, for regulators of financial markets as it sheds light on how procyclicality could be avoided in provisions. © 2019 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","","Commerce; Balance sheets; Corporate bond; Credit risk modeling; Expected loss; Financial networks; Forward looking; Provisioning framework; Term structure; Risk assessment","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85069202427"

Nelson-Siegel model classes discussed here are NS model, BL model, NSS model, RF model, and our proposed NSSE models. NSSE model is a model which extends the standard NS model as Nelson-Siegel model class by adding some linear and non-linear parameters in which form the fourth hump of the model class. The purpose of adding the hump is to accommodate the possibility of having the following cases: the first, the condition when the short term and the medium term yields are higher than the long term yield. The second, the condition when the upper-value short term yields are higher than both the short term yields on average and the long term yields. The third, the case when the upper-value medium term yields are higher than both the medium term yields on average and the long term yields. These considered cases make the yield curve more likely to have minimum locals and therefore, the Nelson-Siegel model classes become more difficult to be estimated. To overcome this problem, in this paper we estimate the model using the hybrid-genetic algorithm approach and compare it with the standard estimation based on NLS method. We provide an empirical study using Indonesian Government-Bond Yield Curve (IGYC) data, and found that the best model for IGYC is 6-factors model. © 2019 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","And Constrained Optimization; Genetic Algorithm; Hybrid Method; Nelson-Siegel Model; Nonlinear Least Square; Yield Curve","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85061360556"

The byproducts of this innovative approach (LLGMM) are the balance between model specification and model prescription of continuous-time dynamic process and the development of discrete-time interconnected dynamic model of local sample mean and variance statistic process (DTIDMLSMVSP). Moreover, LLGMM is a dynamic non-parametric method. The DTIDMLSMVSP is an alternative approach to the GARCH(1,1) model, and it provides an iterative scheme for updating statistic coefficients in a system of generalized method of moment/observation equations. Furthermore, applications of LLGMM to energy commodities price, U.S. Treasury Bill interest rate and the U.S.-U.K. foreign exchange rate data strongly exhibit its unique role, scope and performance, in particular, in forecasting and confidence-interval problems in applied statistics. © 2019 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","conceptual computational/theoretical parameter estimation scheme; forecasting; mean square optimal procedure; method of moments; nonparametric; reaction/response time delay; simulation","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85060695794"

With daily returns of 0.46 percent and a Sharpe ratio of 5.8 prior to transaction costs, we find LSTM networks to outperform memory-free classification methods, i.e., a random forest (RAF), a deep neural net (DNN), and a logistic regression classifier (LOG). The outperformance relative to the general market is very clear from 1992 to 2009, but as of 2010, excess returns seem to have been arbitraged away with LSTM profitability fluctuating around zero after transaction costs. We further unveil sources of profitability, thereby shedding light into the black box of artificial neural networks. Specifically, we find one common pattern among the stocks selected for trading – they exhibit high volatility and a short-term reversal return profile. Leveraging these findings, we are able to formalize a rules-based short-term reversal strategy that yields 0.23 percent prior to transaction costs.

This study applies a stability-oriented approach (SOA) based on statistical tests to compare data for the current period to a past set of data for a stable period, providing higher reliability due to a more abundant source of data. Based on an SOA, this study uses an artificial neural network (ANN), which is one of the commonly applied machine learning algorithms, for simultaneously forecasting the volatility and classifying the level of market stability. In addition, this study develops a dynamic target volatility strategy for asset allocation using an ANN to enhance the ability of a target volatility strategy that is established for automatically allocating capital between a risky asset and a risk-free cash position. In order to examine the impact of the proposed strategy, the results are compared to the buy-and-hold strategy, the static asset allocation strategy, and the conventional target volatility strategy using different volatility forecasting methodologies.

We demonstrate that at low levels of the real bond yield, the correlation between the equity and bond yields turns negative. This arises as the lower bond yield implies heightened macroeconomic risk (e.g. deflation and economic stagnation) and causes equity and bond prices to move in opposite directions. The FED model relies on a positive relation for its success in predicting future returns. Thus, we argue that the mixed empirical evidence regarding the FED model arises due to this switch in correlation behaviour. We present supportive evidence for the switching relation and its link to the level of the bond yield using linear and nonlinear smooth transition panel regression techniques for the G7 markets.

The model resembles the cointegrated VAR model but is novel in that: (i) the stationary relations follow a random coefficient autoregressive process, i.e., exhibhits heavy-tailed dynamics, and (ii) the system is observed with measurement error. Unlike the cointegrated VAR model, estimation and inference for the SSR model is complicated by a lack of closed-form expressions for the likelihood function and its derivatives.

These enable us to approximate the ML estimator via stochastic approximation and to conduct inference via the approximated observed Information matrix. We conjecture the asymptotic properties of the ML estimator and conduct a simulation study to investigate the validity of the conjecture. Model diagnostics to assess model fit are considered.

One reason for this is that rankings of predictive accuracy across alternative models, which under misspecification are loss function dependent, are universally utilized to assess the usefulness of econometric models. A second reason, which corresponds to the objective of this paper, is that researchers are currently focusing considerable attention on so-called big data and on new (and old) tools that are available for the analysis of this data. One of the objectives in this field is the assessment of whether big data leads to improvement in forecast accuracy. In this survey paper, we discuss some of the latest (and most interesting) methods currently available for analyzing and utilizing big data when the objective is improved prediction. Our discussion includes a summary of various so-called dimension reduction, shrinkage and machine learning methods as well as a summary of recent tools that are useful for ranking prediction models associated with the implementation of these methods.

This research uses data informatics to explore transaction characteristics and trading activity of investment grade US municipal bonds. Using the relatively recent data stream distributed by the Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board, we provide an institutional summary of market participants and their trading behavior. Subsequently, we focus on a sample of AAA bonds to derive a new methodology to estimate a trade-weighted benchmark municipal yield curve. The methodology integrates the study of ridge regression, artificial neural networks, and support vector regression. We find an enhanced radial basis function artificial neural network outperforms alternate methods used to estimate municipal term structure. This result forms the foundation for establishing a decision theory on optimal municipal bond trading. Using multivariate modeling of a liquidity domain measured across three dependent variables, we investigate the proposed decision theory by estimating weekly production-theoretic bond liquidity returns to scale. Across the three liquidity measures and for almost all weeks investigated, bond trading liquidity is elastic with respect to the modeled factors. This finding leads us to conclude that an optimal trading policy for municipal debt can be implemented on a weekly timescale using the elasticity estimates of bond price, trade size, risk, days-to-maturity, and the macroeconomic influences of labor in the workforce and building activity. © 2019 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Decision theory; Municipal bonds; Production theory; Supervised learning","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85062701769"

We estimated the cost effectiveness of BRCA mutation testing in early-stage breast cancer patients with high pre-test probability of harbouring the mutation in Malaysia, an LMIC in Asia. Methods: We developed a decision analytic model to estimate the lifetime costs and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) accrued through BRCA mutation testing or routine clinical surveillance (RCS) for a hypothetical cohort of 1000 early-stage breast cancer patients aged 40 years. In the model, patients would decide whether to accept testing and to undertake risk-reducing mastectomy, oophorectomy, tamoxifen, combinations or neither. We calculated the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) from the health system perspective. A series of sensitivity analyses were performed. Results: In the base case, testing generated 11.2 QALYs over the lifetime and cost US$4815 per patient whereas RCS generated 11.1 QALYs and cost US$4574 per patient. The ICER of US$2725/QALY was below the cost-effective thresholds. The ICER was sensitive to the discounting of cost, cost of BRCA mutation testing and utility of being risk-free, but the ICERs remained below the thresholds. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis showed that at a threshold of US$9500/QALY, 99.9% of simulations favoured BRCA mutation testing over RCS. Conclusions: Offering BRCA mutation testing to early-stage breast cancer patients identified using a locally-validated risk-assessment tool may be cost effective compared to RCS in Malaysia. © 2019 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","","BRCA1 protein; tamoxifen; adult; Article; breast cancer; cancer epidemiology; cancer patient; cancer registry; cancer risk; cancer staging; cancer survival; clinical practice; cost effectiveness analysis; early cancer; female; gene mutation; genetic counseling; genetic screening; human; major clinical study; Malaysia; middle income country; ovariectomy; partial mastectomy; quality adjusted life year; risk assessment; sensitivity analysis; sensitivity and specificity; survival rate; breast tumor; cost benefit analysis; developing country; early cancer diagnosis; economics; genetics; Markov chain; mutation; pathology; statistical model; tumor suppressor gene; Breast Neoplasms; Cost-Benefit Analysis; Developed Countries; Early Detection of Cancer; Female; Genes, BRCA1; Genetic Testing; Humans; Likelihood Functions; Markov Chains; Mutation; Quality-Adjusted Life Years; Sensitivity and Specificity","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85044344222"

In the second step, these latent factors are forecast with an econometric model. The term structure of log-forces of mortality is next reconstructed by an inverse transformation.

This paper investigates the contagion from oil prices to Chinese stock sectors by considering differences between extreme positive returns and extreme negative returns. We compute time-varying cut-offs by employing a generalized Pareto distribution (GPD) function to estimate excess returns. We then use a multinomial logit (MNL) model to examine the probability of Chinese stock sector co-exceedances associated with oil price exceedances. Our results indicate that, compared to common domestic factors, the contagion between oil price and stock sectors is relatively weak, but never negligible. We argue that faced with volatile oil prices during turbulent periods, the existence of any contagion weakens the benefits of portfolio diversification related to oil and Chinese stock sector investment. Based on our findings, investors holding a portfolio of oil and Chinese sector stocks should pay special attention to the extreme changes in crude oil prices and adopt hedging measures to protect their portfolio from extreme shocks to oil markets. © 2018 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Chinese stock sectors; Co-exceedances; Contagion; Extreme returns; Oil market","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85034079456"

Unlike the existing measures, ours are able to detect and quantify nonlinear causal effects. The new measures are based on nonparametric regressions and defined as logarithmic functions of restricted and unrestricted mean square forecast errors. They are easily and consistently estimated by replacing the unknown mean square forecast errors by their nonparametric kernel estimates. We derive the asymptotic normality of nonparametric estimator of causality measures, which we use to build tests for their statistical significance. We establish the validity of smoothed local bootstrap that one can use in finite sample settings to perform statistical tests. Monte Carlo simulations reveal that the proposed test has good finite sample size and power properties for a variety of data-generating processes and different sample sizes. Finally, the empirical importance of measuring nonlinear causality in mean is also illustrated. We quantify the degree of nonlinear predictability of equity risk premium using variance risk premium. Our empirical results show that the variance risk premium is a very good predictor of risk premium at horizons less than 6 months. We also find that there is a high degree of predictability at the 1-month horizon, that can be attributed to a nonlinear causal effect.

While DHM only confirms the aftermaths of “stock return volatilities” and “total liabilities” and the positive effects of “stock price” “stock excess return” and “profitability” on businesses, under high quantile levels QHM is able to supplement “cash and short-term investment to total assets” “market capitalization” and “current liabilities ratio” into the list of factors that influence a default. More interestingly, “cash and short-term investment to total assets” and “market capitalization” switch signs in high quantile levels, showing their different influence on companies with different risk levels. We also discover evidence for the distinction of default probability among different industrial sectors.

We compare the original method to modality annotation and support vector machines (SVM) classification in order to create an EPU index for Belgium. Validation on an out-of-sample test set speaks in favour of using an SVM classification model for constructing a news-based policy uncertainty indicator. The indicators are then used to forecast 10 macroeconomic and financial variables. The original method of measuring EPU does not have predictive power for any of these 10 variables. The SVM indicator has a higher predictive power and, notably, changes in the level of policy uncertainty during tumultuous periods of high uncertainty and risk can predict changes in the sovereign bond yield and spread, the credit default swap spread, and consumer confidence. © 2018 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Economic policy; Forecasting; Text mining; Uncertainty","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85001799528"

With portfolio insurance strategy, we divide the money in a risky asset and a risk-free asset. Our applied strategy is based on a constant proportion portfolio insurance strategy. For determining the amount for investing in the risky asset, a critical parameter is a constant risk multiplier that is calculated in our proposed model using RGP to reflect market dynamics. Our model includes four main steps: (1) Selecting the best stocks for constructing a portfolio using a density-based clustering strategy. (2) Enhancing the robustness of our proposed model with an application of the Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference Systems (ANFIS) for forecasting the future prices of the selected stocks. The findings show that using ANFIS, instead of a regular multi-layer artificial neural network improves the prediction accuracy and our model’s robustness. (3) Implementing the RGP model for calculating the risk multiplier. Risk variables are used to generate equation trees for calculating the risk multiplier.

Although there is a vast literature on the quality of life in terms of health, there is no uniform point of view, since the well-being of a person implies other elements that consider not only health but also the economic and educational environment in which the individual evolves and often these factors are connected. Besides, there is no valid instrument for measuring the quality of life either for an adult or for a child. In most cases, alcohol consumption intensifies in time, significantly decresing the quality of life for the mother and especially for the conception product. The study focuses on showing the The study focuses on highlighting the psychosocial and pharmacological aspects relevant to the diagnosis and management of neonatal cerebral status. The study participants, whose responses were the base for the quantitative analyzes, were individually interviewed using a standardized interview protocol. The interviews were conducted between October 2015 and September 2017. The interview protocol included three sections, in this chapter focusing our attention on the following sections: a) socio-demographic characteristics: age of gestation, sex of the newborn; b) clinical data: Presentation, Weight at Birth, Apgar Score, Cerebral Saturation (rSO<inf>2</inf>), Peripheral saturation (SpO<inf>2</inf>), The extraction fraction (FTOE), Parameters harvested from the umbilical cord at birth (pH, Base excess (BE), pCO<inf>2</inf>, pO<inf>2</inf>, MetHb, COHb), c) risk profile: mother’s alcohol consumption, including during pregnancy and drug use. The study group consisted of 90 infants born full term in Elena Doamna Maternity Hospital in Iasi, between 2015-2017, included in the programme of follow-up of the newborn with risk with the purpose of performing an non-invasive assessment of the fetal and neonatal cerebral status, in order to prevent and establish treatment methods for perinatal asphyxia. Based on the information obtained through the preliminary documentation, 30 newborns with alcohol and / or drug-consuming mothers and 60 neonates with risk-free mothers were selected - the control batch, who accepted to participate in the study.The cases studied showed the homogeneity of the groups depending on the mother’s age and gestational age, as well as the sex of the newborn and the weight at birth (p>0.05). In neonates from mothers at risk, the under-reference level of 1-minute brain saturation, combined with a lower gestational age and the 62.5% probability of performing a caesarean section at low levels of cerebral saturation was noted in 66.7% of newborns.The cut off value of SpO<inf>2</inf>, was established at 70 mL/ 100g/1 min, with a sensitivity of 50.9% and a specificity of 51.3%, after reading the coordinates of ROC curve, but the prediction was not significant from the statistical point of view (p=0.670). The mean level of base excess was al excesului de baze was slightly lower in newborns with the extraction fraction below the cut off value (-4.64 vs -4.18; p=0.560). According to the cases studied, 1 min after birth, 23.3% of the newborns showed an increased level of pCO<inf>2</inf> associated with a reduced level of peripheral saturation (r= -0.231; p=0.05). The correlation between the pO<inf>2</inf> level and the cerebral saturation, recorded 1 min after birth, was direct, but reduced as intensity (r= +0.295; p=0.049).

Meanwhile, various risk measurements such as variance, entropy, and Value-At-Risk have been proposed in fuzzy environments to evaluate investment risks from different perspectives. Sharpe ratio, also known as the reward-To-variability ratio, which measures the risk premium per unit of the nonsystematic risk (asset deviation), has received great attention in modern portfolio theory. In this study, the Sharpe ratio in fuzzy environments is introduced, whereafter, a fuzzy Value-At-Risk ratio is proposed. Compared with Sharpe ratio, Value-At-Risk ratio is an index with dimensional knowledge that reflects the risk premium per unit of the systematic risk (the greatest loss under a given confidence level). On the basis of the two ratios, a multi-objective model is built to evaluate their joint impact on portfolio selection. Then, the proposed model is solved by a fuzzy simulation based multi-objective particle swarm optimization algorithm, where the global best of each iteration is determined by an improved dominance times based method. Finally, the algorithm superiority is justified via comparing with existing solvers on benchmark problems, and the model effectiveness is exemplified by using three case studies on portfolio selection. © 2018 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Fuzzy portfolio selection; multi-objective particle swarm optimization (MOPSO); Sharpe ratio (SR); Value-At-Risk (VaR) ratio","Entropy; Fuzzy sets; Investments; Iterative methods; Multiobjective optimization; Particle swarm optimization (PSO); Reactive power; Risk assessment; Screening; Sorting; Value engineering; Multi objective particle swarm optimization; Portfolio selection; Portfolios; Security; Sharpe ratios; Value at Risk; Fuzzy set theory","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85048015630"

Findings: The authors find that the nature of the predictive relationship between crude oil and the US stock market changed in the latter half of 2008. After mid-2008, the predictive relationship switched signs and exhibited characteristics which make it much more likely that the predictive relationship is due to time-varying risk premia rather than a market inefficiency.

Grain products and feed grain contaminated with deoxynivalenol (DON) (commonly known as vomitoxin) are subject to Food and Drug Administration advisory limits and as a result end-users place restrictions on their use. This has led to steep price discounts, as well as higher risks for producers and grain merchandisers. Varietal research has led to development of varieties that are resistant or moderately resistant to FHB. Studies indicate combinations of genetic resistance, fungicides and some management practices (combine settings, tillage practices, etc.) can be used to decrease economic costs due to FHB. The purpose of this study was to estimate the economic costs of scab. To do so we developed several economic models, analysed extensive data and conducted surveys of wheat flour millers, barley maltsters, and grain handlers. A detailed assessment of costs indicates the most important costs accrued by the wheat and barley industries were the risk premium paid to induce adoption of DON reducing technologies and the value of yield forgone. These were followed by the direct costs of fungicide, added shipping costs, testing and segregation and discounts. © 2018 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Economic costs; Fusarium head blight; Risk premiums","fungicide; vomitoxin; Article; barley; economic aspect; economic model; Fusarium head blight; genetic resistance; grain; nonhuman; risk assessment; wheat flour","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85041413469"

In particular, we model the asset returns as random variables and estimate their probability distributions by the Capital Asset Pricing Model or Fama-French 3-factor model, and measure the relative market risk with the coherent semideviation risk function.

This may be partly due to limited data availability. However, emerging bond markets are becoming increasingly important and liquid. It is, therefore, important to be understand whether conclusions drawn from developed countries carry over to emerging markets. We estimate model parameters of fully flexible Nelson–Siegel–Svensson term structures model which has become one of the most popular term structure model among academics, practitioners, and central bankers. We investigate four sets of bond data: U.S. Treasuries, and three major emerging market government bond data-sets (Brazil, Mexico and Turkey). By including both the very dense U.S. data and the comparatively sparse emerging market data, we ensure that are results are not specific to a particular data-set. We find that gradient and direct search methods perform poorly in estimating term structures of interest rates, while global optimization methods, particularly the hybrid particle swarm optimization introduced in this paper, do well. Our results are consistent across four countries, both in- and out-of-sample, and for perturbations in prices and starting values. For academics and practitioners interested in optimization methods, this study provides clear evidence of the practical importance of choice of optimization method and validates a method that works well for the NSS model. © 2018 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Nelson–Siegel–Svensson; Particle swarm optimization; Robust estimation; Term structure","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84982966106"

To this end, they should consider to establish a project portfolio to make decisions. When building such a portfolio, the project selection and the staff assignment are the most essential parts, which greatly affect the profit of project portfolios. As for the project selection, market returns tend to be asymmetric and investors are often concerned about the skewness risk which is ignored by the traditional project portfolio. Meanwhile, as for the staff assignment, the institutional investors aim at achieving the highest returns by adopting a proper assignment of project managers. In addition, since the exact possibility distributions of uncertain parameters in practical project portfolio problems are often unavailable, we adopt variable parametric credibility measure to characterize uncertain model parameters. In view of these problems, this article proposes a project portfolio model with skewness risk constraints and a project portfolio model with staffing based on credibility measure theory and fuzzy theory in uncertain circumstances. Our two models are associated with risk-free assets so that the remaining funds can be utilized effectively. Finally, we use genetic algorithms to solve our proposed models and present some numerical examples to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed models. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Credibility measure; Fuzzy theory; Genetic algorithm; Project portfolio; Skewness risk; Staffing","Higher order statistics; Investments; Parameter estimation; Personnel selection; Risk assessment; Uncertainty analysis; Business operation; Credibility measure; Fuzzy theory; Market returns; Portfolio model; Project portfolio; Project selection; Skewness risk; Staff assignments; Staffing; Genetic algorithms","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85037379412"

The core idea of this study is to outline an automated framework for achieving a faster and easier parameter selection process, and at the same time, generating useful prediction uncertainty estimates in order to effectively tackle flexible real-world financial time series prediction problems. A Bayesian approach to SVR is discussed, and implemented. It is found that the direct implementation of the probabilistic framework of Gao et al. returns unsatisfactory results in our experiments. A novel enhancement is proposed by adding a new kernel scaling parameter μ to overcome the difficulties encountered. In addition, the multi-armed bandit Bayesian optimization technique is applied to automate the parameter selection process. Our framework is then tested on financial time series of various asset classes (i.e. equity index, credit default swaps spread, bond yields, and commodity futures) to ensure its flexibility. It is shown that the generalization performance of this parameter selection process can reach or sometimes surpass the computationally expensive cross-validation procedure. An adaptive calibration process is also described to allow practical use of the prediction uncertainty estimates to assess the quality of predictions. It is shown that the machine-learning approach discussed in this study can be developed as a very useful pricing tool, and potentially a market condition change detector. A further extension is possible by taking the prediction uncertainties into consideration when building a financial portfolio. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Bayesian inference; Gaussian process; Kernel scaling; Machine learning; Multi-armed bandit Bayesian optimization; Support vector machines regression","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85014617588"

This paper investigates whether the use of models which allow for negative interest rates can improve option pricing and implied volatility forecasting. This is done with special attention to foreign exchange and index options. To this end, we carried out an empirical analysis on the prices of call and put options on the US S&P 500 index and Eurodollar futures using a generalization of the Heston model in the stochastic interest rate framework. Specifically, the dynamics of the option’s underlying asset is described by two factors: a stochastic variance and a stochastic interest rate. The volatility is not allowed to be negative, but the interest rate is. Explicit formulas for the transition probability density function and moments are derived. These formulas are used to estimate the model parameters efficiently. Three empirical analyses are illustrated. The first two show that the use of models which allow for negative interest rates can efficiently reproduce implied volatility and forecast option prices (i.e. S&P index and foreign exchange options).

However, in some practical cases, for example, due to the absence of historical data, the inherent uncertain characteristic of risks or different subject judgements from the decision-makers, risks may be hard or not appropriate to be estimated with probability distributions. Therefore, the traditional probabilistic risk aversion theory is ineffective. Thus, in order to deal with these cases, we suggest measuring these kinds of risks as fuzzy variables, and accordingly to present an alternative risk aversion approach by employing credibility theory. In the present paper, first, the definition of credibilistic risk premium proposed by Georgescu and Kinnunen [Fuzzy Inf. Eng., 2013, 5, 399–416] is revised by taking the initial wealth into consideration, and then a general method to compute the credibilistic risk premium is provided. Secondly, regarding the risks represented with the commonly used LR fuzzy intervals, a simple calculation formula of the local credibilistic risk premium is put forward. Finally, in a global sense, several equivalent propositions for comparative risk aversion under the credibility measurement are provided. Illustrated examples are presented to show the applicability of the theoretical findings. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Credibilistic risk premium; Credibility theory; LR fuzzy interval; Risk aversion","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85008225393"

We find a change from stable to unstable dynamics if the external debt to capital ratio rises above a certain threshold. Risk premia are introduced highlighting the state-dependent borrowing costs for the dynamic paths. We study excess debt and over-leveraging as deviations from sustainable ratios.

The recent development of machine learning techniques has spurred a plethora of studies that further improves the prediction models for currency markets. This high-tech progress may create challenges for market efficiency along with information asymmetry and irrationality of decision-making. This technological bias emerges from the fact that recent innovative approaches have been used to solve trading tasks and to find the best trading strategies. This paper demonstrates that traders can leverage technological bias for financial market forecasting. Those traders who adapt faster to the changes in market innovations will get excess returns. To support this hypothesis we compare the performance of deep learning methods, shallow neural networks with baseline prediction methods and a random walk model using daily closing rate between three currency pairs: Euro and US Dollar (EUR/USD), British Pound and US Dollar (GBP/USD), and US Dollar and Japanese Yen (USD/JPY). The results demonstrate that deep learning achieves higher accuracy than alternate methods.

However, the stock market proved volatile, and only rarely could investors gain excess returns when trading in real time. Most investors use technical indicators to time the market. However the use of technical indicators is associated with problems, such as indicator selection, use of conflicting versus similar indicators. Investors thus have difficulty relying on technical indicators to make stock market investment decisions. This research combines Markov decision process and genetic algorithms to propose a new analytical framework and develop a decision support system for devising stock trading strategies. This investigation uses the prediction characteristics and real-time analysis capabilities of the Markov decision process to make timing decisions. The stock selection and capital allocation employ string encoding to express different investment strategies for genetic algorithms. The parallel search capabilities of genetic algorithms are applied to identify the best investment strategy.

In this paper we evaluate nonlinear machine learning and econometric methodologies in forecasting US inflation based on autoregressive and structural models of the term structure. We employ two nonlinear methodologies: the econometric least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) and the machine-learning support vector regression (SVR) method. The SVR has never been used before in inflation forecasting considering the term spread as a regressor. In doing so, we use a long monthly dataset spanning the period 1871:1–2015:3 that covers the entire history of inflation in the US economy. For comparison purposes we also use ordinary least squares regression models as a benchmark. In order to evaluate the contribution of the term spread in inflation forecasting in different time periods, we measure the out-of-sample forecasting performance of all models using rolling window regressions. Considering various forecasting horizons, the empirical evidence suggests that the structural models do not outperform the autoregressive ones, regardless of the model's method. Thus we conclude that the term spread models are not more accurate than autoregressive models in inflation forecasting.

This proposed method is composed of: 1) development of the stochastic model for continuous-time dynamic process; 2) development of the discrete-time interconnected dynamic model for statistic process; 3) utilization of Euler-type discretized scheme for nonlinear and nonstationary system of stochastic differential equations; 4) development of generalized method of moment/observation equations by employing lagged adaptive expectation process; 5) introduction of the conceptual and computational parameter estimation problem; 6) formulation of the conceptual and computational state estimation scheme; and 7) definition of the conditional mean square ε-best sub-optimal procedure. The development of LLGMM is motivated by parameter and state estimation problems in continuous-time nonlinear and nonstationary stochastic dynamic model validation problems in biological, chemical, engineering, financial, medical, physical, and social sciences. The byproducts of LLGMM are the balance between model specification and model prescription of continuous-time dynamic process and the development of discrete-time interconnected dynamic model of local sample mean and variance statistic process (DTIDMLSMVSP). DTIDMLSMVSP is the generalization of statistic (sample mean and variance) drawn from the static dynamic population problems.

While it was slightly positive on average in the period 1953 to 2014, it was unusually high in the early 1980s and negative in the early 21st Century, particularly in the downturns of 2001 and 2007 to 2009. This paper specifies and estimates a model in which the nominal term structure of interest rates is driven by four state variables: the real interest rate, temporary and permanent components of expected inflation, and the nominalreal covariance of inflation and the real interest rate with the real economy. The last of these state variables enables the model to fit the changing covariance of bond and stock returns. In the model, a high nominal-real covariance implies a high term premium and a concave yield curve. The decline in this covariance since the early 1980s has driven down our model-implied term premium on 10-year zero-coupon nominal Treasury bonds by about two percentage points. © 2018 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Inflation risk; Nonlinear term structure model; Term premia; TIPS","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85019756733"

However, many researchers have shown that this assumption is violated in practice. Such violations include the statistical properties of heavy tails, volatility clustering, leptokurtosis and long memory. This paper considers the pricing of contingent claims when the underlying is assumed to display long memory, an issue that has heretofore not received much attention. Aim: We address several theoretical and practical issues in option pricing and implied volatility calibration in a fractional Black–Scholes market. We introduce a novel eight-parameter fractional Black–Scholes-inspired (FBSI) model for the implied volatility surface, and consider in depth the issue of calibration. One of the main benefits of such a model is that it allows one to decompose implied volatility into an independent long-memory component – captured by an implied Hurst exponent – and a conditional implied volatility component. Such a decomposition has useful applications in the areas of derivatives trading, risk management, delta hedging and dynamic asset allocation. Setting: The proposed FBSI volatility model is calibrated to South African equity index options data as well as South African Rand/American Dollar currency options data. However, given the focus on the theoretical development of the model, the results in this paper are applicable across all financial markets. Methods: The FBSI model essentially combines a deterministic function form of the 1-year implied volatility skew with a separate deterministic function for the implied Hurst exponent, thus allowing one to model both observed implied volatility surfaces as well as decompose them into independent volatility and long-memory components respectively. Calibration of the model makes use of a quasi-explicit weighted least-squares optimisation routine. Results: It is shown that a fractional Black–Scholes model always admits a non-constant implied volatility term structure when the Hurst exponent is not 0.5, and that 1-year implied volatility is independent of the Hurst exponent and equivalent to fractional volatility. Furthermore, we show that the FBSI model fits the equity index implied volatility data very well but that a more flexible Hurst exponent parameterisation is required to fit accurately the currency implied volatility data. Conclusion: The FBSI model is an arbitrage-free deterministic volatility model that can accurately model equity index implied volatility. It also provides one with an estimate of the implied Hurst exponent, which could be very useful in derivatives trading and delta hedging. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Calibration; Currency; Equity; Fractional Brownian motion; Hurst exponent; Implied volatility; Volatility surface","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85016639472"

We use the classification and regression tree methodology and its random forest extension, which permits the detection of key variables driving binary crisis outcomes, allows for interactions among key variables and determines critical tipping points. We distinguish between basic country conditions, country structural characteristics and international developments. We find that crises are more varied than they are similar. For banking crises, we find that low net interest rate spreads in the banking sector and a shallow, or inverted, yield curve is their most important forerunners in the short term. In the longer term, it is high house price inflation. For currency crises, high domestic short-term rates coupled with overvalued exchange rates are the most powerful short-term predictors. We find that both country structural characteristics and international developments are relevant banking-crisis predictors. Currency crises, however, seem to be driven more by country idiosyncratic, short-term developments. We find that some variables, such as the domestic credit gap, provide important unconditional signals, but it is difficult to use them as conditional signals and, more importantly, to find relevant threshold values.

Compared to benchmark autoregressive (AR) models, both the DFM and ANN offer more accurate forecasts with reduced root-mean-square error (RMSE) of around 2–12 % for all variables and over all forecasting horizons. The ANN as a nonlinear combining method outperforms all linear combining methods for all variables and over all forecasting horizons. The results suggest that the ANN combining method can be used as an alternative to linear combining methods to achieve greater forecasting accuracy. The ANN combining method produces out-of-sample forecasts that are substantially more accurate with a sizeable reduction in RMSE of both the AR benchmark model and the best individual forecasting model.

Historical stock market behavior and recent empirical experience have led economists and policy makers to acknowledge that price bubbles in financial markets do occur and need to be accounted for in risk analysis. New econometric tools for analyzing mildly explosive behavior (Phillips and Magdalinos, 2007; Phillips et al., 2011) have made it possible to detect the presence of bubbles in data and to date stamp their origination and collapse, providing empirical confirmation of such episodes in recent data. The potential for price bubbles and market collapse provides another source of stock market risk and adds to the risk premium. We provide an analytic and empirical investigation of this additional risk factor. The standard present value model is extended to allow for possible price bubbles and the effects of integrating bubble behavior into a consumption-based asset pricing model are analyzed. The theory involves attention to the investor time horizon and a study of the validity of conventional log linear approximations in the presence of nonstationary and mildly explosive data. Finite decision horizons accommodate myopic investors and are a component of speculative behavior that focuses on short run market gains rather than long run effects of fundamentals. An econometric approach to estimate bubble risk effects is developed and the methods are applied to composite stock market index data, giving new model-based equity premium and market volatility estimates that more closely match the data than traditional consumption based asset pricing models. © 2016 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Asset pricing; Bubbles; Financial market anomalies; Log linear approximation; Mildly explosive time series; Present value model","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-84954285389"

This and the well known stock-bond correlation motivates the inclusion of the current bond yield in a model for the prediction of excess stock returns. Here, we take the actuarial long term view using yearly data, and focus on nonlinear relationships between a set of covariates. We employ fully nonparametric models and apply for estimation a local-linear kernel smoother. Since the current bond yield is not known, it is predicted in a prior step.

The proposed method is computationally efficient compared with the standard techniques, and it provides a convenient way to compute the statistical moments of the solution numerically. Numerical results and useful formulas for estimating the stochastic duration and immunization are presented. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Heath–Jarrow–Morton equation; Kalman filter; Monte Carlo; Numerical methods; Wiener chaos","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-84973596637"

The paper draws out lessons for the Euro zone from US and UK experience. Numerous event studies have been undertaken to uncover the effects of QE on yields on and prices of financial assets. Estimated effects on long-term government bond yields are then converted into the size of the cut in the policy rate that would normally have been needed to produce them. From these implicit cuts in policy rates, estimates of the effect on GDP and inflation are generated. Euro zone QE appears to have had a much smaller effect on bond yields for the core members states than did QE in the US or UK. Therefore its effects on output and inflation are likely to be proportionately smaller. Its effects on long-term government bond yields in periphery members are greater. QE is compressing interest differential among Euro zone member states. The dangers of QE to which various commentators draw attention, that it creates a danger of inflation in the future, that it creates asset price bubbles, that it allows zombie firms and banks to survive, slowing down the process of adjustment, seem remote. Meanwhile it makes a useful contribution to cutting the costs of debt service and allowing member states more fiscal room for maneouvre. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Euro zone; European Central Bank; Financial crisis; Quantitative easing; Unconventional monetary policy","central bank; European Union; financial crisis; government; Gross Domestic Product; monetary policy; monetary union; United Kingdom; United States","Review","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84959868750"

One candidate explanation is that funds process information about future asset values and use that information to invest in high-valued assets. But formal theories are scarce because information choice models with many assets are difficult to solve as well as difficult to test. This paper tackles both problems by developing a new attention allocation model that uses the state of the business cycle to predict information choices, which in turn, predict observable patterns of portfolio investments and returns. The predictions about fund portfolios' covariance with payoff shocks, cross-fund portfolio and return dispersion, and their excess returns are all supported by the data.

For comparison purpose, autoregressive moving average model, random walk process and the naive model are used as main reference models. In order to show the feasibility of the presented hybrid models that combine multiresolution analysis techniques and feedforward neural network optimized by particle swarm optimization, we used a set of six illustrative interest rates; including Moody's seasoned Aaa corporate bond yield, Moody's seasoned Baa corporate bond yield, 3-Month, 6-Month and 1-Year treasury bills, and effective federal fund rate.

The previous literature has emphasized the deployment of expert systems and knowledge-discovery approaches motivated by the need to address the limitations of the econometric models. However, it has failed to address the interpretability aspects and, more importantly, the need to provide methodological support that allows the deployment of such techniques in a more systematic way. This approach entails the definition of a process that includes the usual steps taken by experts to address similar problems and allows the relative merits of different techniques in relation to common goals and objectives to be gauged. This paper addresses the interpretability and the lack of methodological support by proposing a knowledge-discovery methodology that includes a minimal common number of steps to model, analyse, evaluate and deploy different non-linear techniques and models. Furthermore, the interpretability is addressed through the use of open-box techniques, such as decision trees. The proposed methodology helps to discover and describe hidden patterns, allowing for the study and characterization of economic cycles, and economic cycle stages, as well as the description of the historic relationships between interest rates and other relevant economic variables. These patterns can also be used in the forecasting of economic cycle stages, interest rates and other related variables of concern. The output of the methodology can provide actionable information for market agents, such as monetary authorities, financial institutions, and individual investors, as well as for the academic community, to increase further the knowledge and understanding of financial markets, thus enriching and complementing existing financial theories. © 2015 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Data mining; Decision trees; Economic cycles; Forecasting; Interest rates; Yield curve","Commerce; Data mining; Decision trees; Expert systems; Finance; Forecasting; Forestry; Risk assessment; Trees (mathematics); Economic cycles; Economic variables; Financial institution; Financial variables; Interest rates; Modelling and forecasting; Nonlinear techniques; Yield curve; Economics","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-84945251489"

These data enable investors to understand the credit levels of debtors from a bank perspective; this facilitates predicting the debtor default rate to efficiently evaluate investment risks. The paper aims to discuss these issues. Design/methodology/approach: A credit rating model can be developed to reduce the risk of adverse selection and moral hazard caused by information asymmetry in the loan market. In this study, a random forest (RF) was used to evaluate financial variables and construct credit rating prediction models. Data-mining techniques, including an RF, decision tree, neural networks, and support vector machine, were used to search for suitable credit rating forecasting methods. The distance to default from the KMV model was then incorporated into the credit rating model as a research variable to increase predictive power of various data-mining techniques. In addition, four-level and nine-level classification were set to investigate the accuracy rates of various models. Findings: The experimental results indicated that applying the RF in the variable feature selection process and developing a forecasting model was the most effective method of predicting credit ratings; the four-level and nine-level feature-selection settings achieved 95.5 and 87.8 percent accuracy rates, respectively, indicating that RF demonstrated outstanding feature selection and forecasting capacity. Research limitations/implications: The experimental cases were based on financial data from public companies in North America. Practical implications: Practical implication of this study indicates the most effective financial variables were dividends common/ordinary, cash dividends, volatility assumption, and risk-free rate assumption. Originality/value: The RF model can be used to perform feature selection and efficiently filter numerous financial variables to obtain crediting rating information instantly. © 2018 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Decision making; Knowledge management","Commerce; Data mining; Decision making; Decision trees; Economics; Feature extraction; Filtration; Finance; Investments; Knowledge management; Rating; Risk management; Risk perception; Credit rating prediction; Design/methodology/approach; Distance to defaults; Financial variables; Forecasting methods; Forecasting modeling; Information asymmetry; Optimal investments; Forecasting","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85002061891"

We developed a generational accounting model that simulates the flow of taxes paid by the individual, minus direct government transfers received over the individual's lifetime. The difference between discounted transfers and taxes minus the cost of either IVF or artificial insemination (AI) equals the net fiscal contribution (NFC) of a child conceived through assisted reproduction. We conducted sensitivity analysis to test the robustness of our results under various macroeconomic scenarios. A child conceived through assisted reproduction would contribute €370,482 in net taxes to the Spanish Treasury and would receive €275,972 in transfers over their lifetime. Taking into account that only 75% of assisted reproduction pregnancies are successful, the NFC was estimated at €66,709 for IVF-conceived children and €67,253 for AI-conceived children. The return on investment for each euro invested was €15.98 for IVF and €18.53 for AI. The long-term NFC of a child conceived through assisted reproduction could range from €466,379 to €-9,529 (IVF) and from €466,923 to €-8,985 (AI). The return on investment would vary between €-2.28 and €111.75 (IVF), and €-2.48 and €128.66 (AI) for each euro invested. The break-even point at which the financial position would begin to favour the Spanish Treasury ranges between 29 and 41 years of age. Investment in assisted reproductive techniques may lead to positive discounted future fiscal revenue, notwithstanding its beneficial psychological effect for infertile couples in Spain. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","generational accounting; health economics; health investment; IVF; live birth","diesel fuel; gasoline; accounting; alcohol consumption; Article; artificial insemination; education; funding; government employee; health care cost; human; in vitro fertilization; infertility therapy; investment; pension; priority journal; productivity; salary; sensitivity analysis; smoking; social security; Spain; tax; unemployment","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-84992166076"

We consider the problem of estimating the (drift) parameters indexing the drift term of a threshold diffusion process with continuous-time observations. Maximum likelihood estimation of the drift parameters requires prior knowledge of the functional form of the diffusion term, which is, however, often unavailable. We propose a quasi-likelihood approach for estimating the drift parameters of a two-regime threshold diffusion process that does not require prior knowledge about the functional form of the diffusion term. We show that, under mild regularity conditions, the quasi-likelihood estimators of the drift parameters are consistent. Moreover, the estimator of the threshold parameter is super consistent and weakly converges to some non-Gaussian continuous distribution. Also, the estimators of the autoregressive parameters in the drift term are jointly asymptotically normal with distribution the same as that when the threshold parameter is known. The empirical properties of the quasi-likelihood estimator are studied by simulation. We apply the threshold model to estimate the term structure of a long time series of US interest rates. The proposed approach and asymptotic results can be readily lifted to the case of a multi-regime threshold diffusion process. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Girsanov's theorem; Interest rates; Nonlinear time series; Stochastic differential equation; Term structure","Continuous time systems; Differential equations; Diffusion; Estimation; Maximum likelihood; Maximum likelihood estimation; Nonlinear equations; Piecewise linear techniques; Stochastic systems; Time series; Girsanov's theorem; Interest rates; Nonlinear time series; Stochastic differential equations; Term structure; Parameter estimation","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84945479216"

Design Literature review with recommendations. Methods Literature review of science communication best practices to inform recommendations for patient-clinician discussions about ocular gene therapy. Results Clinicians need to employ communications about ocular gene therapy that are both attentive to patient priorities and concerns and responsive to other sources of information, including overly positive news media and the Internet. Coverage often conflates research with therapy - clinical trials are experimental and are not risk free. If proven safe and efficacious, gene therapy may present a treatment but not a cure for patients who have already experienced vision loss. Clinicians can assist patients by providing realistic estimates for lengthy clinical development timelines and positioning current research within models of clinical translation. This enables patients to weigh future therapeutic options when making current disease management decisions. Conclusions Ocular gene therapy clinical trials are raising hopes for treating a myriad of hereditary retinopathies, but most such therapies are many years in the future. Clinicians should be prepared to counter overly positive messaging, found in news media and on the Internet, with optimism tempered by evidence to support the ethical translation of gene therapy and other novel biotherapeutics. © 2018 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","","virus vector; age related macular degeneration; biological therapy; choroideremia; clinical research; clinical trial; drug safety; drug tolerability; gene mutation; gene therapy; genetic screening; human; Leber congenital amaurosis; Leber hereditary optic neuropathy; priority journal; retinitis pigmentosa; retinopathy; retinoschisis; Review; Stargardt disease; treatment outcome; Usher syndrome; vision; visual impairment; doctor patient relation; Eye Diseases; medical information; patient education; patient participation; Genetic Therapy; Health Communication; Humans; Patient Education as Topic; Patient Participation; Physician-Patient Relations","Article","Final","All Open Access; Bronze Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-84939258801"

Therefore, this paper aims to provide the first systematic literature review on the state-of-the-art application of EC techniques for rule discovery in stock AT. Out of 650 articles published before 2013 (inclusive), 51 relevant articles from 24 journals were confirmed. These papers were reviewed and grouped into three analytical method categories (fundamental analysis, technical analysis, and blending analysis) and three EC technique categories (evolutionary algorithm, swarm intelligence, and hybrid EC techniques). A significant bias toward the applications of genetic algorithm-based (GA) and genetic programming-based (GP) techniques in technical trading rule discovery is observed. Other EC techniques and fundamental analysis lack sufficient study. Furthermore, we summarize the information on the evaluation scheme of selected papers and particularly analyze the researches which compare their models with buy and hold strategy (B&H). We observe an interesting phenomenon where most of the existing techniques perform effectively in the downtrend and poorly in the uptrend, and considering the distribution of research in the classification framework, we suggest that this phenomenon can be attributed to the inclination of factor selections and problem in transaction cost selections. We also observe the significant influence of the transaction cost change on the margins of excess return. Other influenced factors are also presented in detail. The absence of ways for market trend prediction and the selection of transaction cost are two major limitations of the studies reviewed. In addition, the combination of trading rule discovery techniques and portfolio selection is a major research gap. Our review reveals the research focus and gaps in applying EC techniques for rule discovery in stock AT and suggests a roadmap for future research. © 2015 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Algorithmic trading; Classification framework; Evolutionary computation; Literature review; Rule discovery; Stock trading rule","Algorithms; Artificial intelligence; Blending; Calculations; Commerce; Costs; Data mining; Evolutionary algorithms; Genetic algorithms; Genetic programming; Algorithmic trading; Classification framework; Literature reviews; Rule discovery; Stock trading; Electronic trading","Review","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84939799429"

The experimental literature has ascertained that this uncertainty (ambiguity) might affect decision makers' preferences. Then, the decision maker might wish to incorporate ambiguity aversion in the analysis. We investigate the modeling ambiguity attitudes in the solution of decision analysis problems through functionals well-established in the decision theory literature. We obtain the multiple-event problems for subjective expected utility, smooth ambiguity and maximin decision makers. This allows us to establish the conditions under which these alternative decision makers face equivalent problems. Results for certainty equivalents and risk premia in the presence of both risk and ambiguity aversion are obtained. A recent generalization of the classical Arrow-Pratt quadratic approximation allows us to quantify the portions of a premium due to risk-PLXINSERT-, and to ambiguity-aversion. The numerical implementation of the objective functions is addressed, showing that all functionals can be estimated at no additional burden through Monte Carlo simulation. The well known Carter Racing case study is addressed quantitatively to demonstrate the findings. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Ambiguity theory; Certainty equivalents; Decision analysis; Decision trees","Decision making; Decision trees; Monte Carlo methods; Ambiguity attitude; Ambiguity aversion; Ambiguity theory; Certainty equivalent; Numerical implementation; Objective functions; Quadratic approximation; Subjective expected utility; Decision theory","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84926408325"

The DPSM allows for flexible investments, setting relatively aggressive investment targets when market growth is expected and relatively conservative targets when the market is expected to be less attractive. The model further allows investments to be liquidated into risk-free assets when the market forecast is pessimistic. By dynamically determining the investment target, the DPSM allows construction of portfolios that are more responsive to market changes, while eliminating the possibility of the model becoming infeasible under certain market conditions. When the proposed DPSM is implemented in real-life investment scenarios using the AIS, the portfolio is rebalanced according to a predefined rebalancing cycle and the model's input parameters are estimated on each rebalancing date using an exponentially weighted moving average (EWMA) estimator. To evaluate the performance of the proposed approach, a 7-year investment experiment was conducted using historical stock returns data from 10 different stock markets around the world. Performance was assessed and compared using diverse measures. Superior performance was achieved using the AIS proposed herein compared with various benchmark approaches for all performance measures. In addition, we identified a converse relationship between the average trading volume of a market and the value of the weighting parameter prescribed to the EWMA estimator, which maximizes cumulative returns in each market. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","adaptive investment strategy; dynamic portfolio selection model; mean-variance portfolio selection; non-linear programming; portfolio rebalancing","Benchmarking; Commerce; Financial markets; Forecasting; Nonlinear programming; Parameter estimation; Strategic planning; Dynamic portfolio selection; Exponentially weighted moving average; Investment strategy; Market condition; Mean-variance portfolios; Performance measure; Rebalancing; Trading volumes; Investments","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84937210799"

The risk parameters are evaluated in an event-based probabilistic framework for a set of hazard events; these results are probabilistically integrated including, in a formal way, all uncertainties related to every part of the process. The hazard is defined as a stochastic or historic set of events, collectively exhaustive and mutually exclusive, that describes the spatial distribution, the annual frequency, and the randomness of the hazard intensity. The risk is expressed in different economic terms: the average annual loss (or pure risk premium) and the loss exceedance curve; these metrics are of particular importance for risk retention (financing) schemes or risk transfer instruments. As an illustrative example, this approach is applied to probabilistic drought risk assessment of maize under rainfed conditions in Mexico. These results are the base of further studies in defining strategies for financial protection against agricultural losses and disasters. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Agricultural drought risk; AME file type; Average annual loss; Financial risk; Loss exceedance curve; Pure premium; Rainfed conditions","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84925490174"

We apply filtering techniques to obtain the diffusion of the credit assets under partial observation and show that they have a specific excess return with respect to the benchmark. The investor performs a simple mean-variance allocation on credit assets. However, returns and variance matrix have to be computed by a numerical method such as Monte Carlo, because of the dynamics of the system and the non-linearity of the asset prices. We use the theory of Dirichlet forms to deal with the uncertainty on the excess returns. This approach provides an estimation of the bias and the variance of the optimal allocation, and return.

This paper examines whether the channel was important in the post-WWII U.S., with particular attention to the 2009 Recovery Act period.

The extension aims to increase the level of accuracy in determine the yield curve.

Examples include structural business cycle estimation, implied volatility smile, the yield curve. Having embedded these quantities into continuous random curves, estimation of the covariance function is needed to extract factors, perform dimensionality reduction, and conduct inference on the factor scores. A series expansion for the covariance function is considered. Under summability restrictions on the absolute values of the coefficients in the series expansion, an estimation procedure that is resilient to overfitting is proposed. Under certain conditions, the rate of consistency for the resulting estimator achieves the minimax rate, allowing the observations to be weakly dependent. When the domain of the functional data is K(>1) dimensional, the absolute summability restriction of the coefficients avoids the so called curse of dimensionality. As an application, a Box-Pierce statistic to test independence of partially observed functional data is derived.

Typically, a longer sequence of CAG repeat length is associated with increased risk of experiencing earlier onset of HD. Previous studies of the association between HD onset age and CAG length have favored a logistic model, where the CAG repeat length enters the mean and variance components of the logistic model in a complex exponential-linear form. To relax the parametric assumption of the exponential-linear association to the true HD onset distribution, we propose to leave both mean and variance functions of the CAG repeat length unspecified and perform semiparametric estimation in this context through a local kernel and backfitting procedure. Motivated by including family history of HD information available in the family members of participants in the Cooperative Huntington's Observational Research Trial (COHORT), we develop the methodology in the context of mixture data, where some subjects have a positive probability of being risk free. We also allow censoring on the age at onset of disease and accommodate covariates other than the CAG length. We study the theoretical properties of the proposed estimator and derive its asymptotic distribution. Finally, we apply the proposed methods to the COHORT data to estimate the HD onset distribution using a group of study participants and the disease family history information available on their family members. © 2013 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. © 2013 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. © 2014 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Age at onset; Chronic disease; Mixture; Partially linear model; Varying-coefficient model","article; CAG repeat; controlled study; data analysis; disease association; Huntington chorea; intermethod comparison; mathematical model; nonparametric test; onset age; parametric test; probability; age at onset; chronic disease; mixture; partially linear model; varying-coefficient model; Age of Onset; Computer Simulation; Family; Female; Humans; Huntington Disease; Male; Models, Genetic; Trinucleotide Repeats","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-84896717351"

Particular attention is given to the interplay between imperfect information about real economic activity, including supply, demand, and inventory accumulation, and speculative activity in oil markets. Furthermore, I present new evidence that there were economically and statistically significant effects of investor flows on futures prices, after controlling for returns in the United States and emerging-economy stock markets, a measure of the balance sheet flexibility of large financial institutions, open interest, the futures/spot basis, and lagged returns on oil futures. The largest impacts on futures prices were from intermediate-term growth rates of index positions and managed-money spread positions. Moreover, my findings suggest that these effects were through risk or informational channels distinct from changes in convenience yield.

The task is particularly challenging due to the sparseness of the data samples and the complex interactions amongst the variables. At the same time, it is of high significance because of the important and paradigmatic role played by the US market in the world economy. Four data-driven artificial intelligence approaches are considered: a manually built fuzzy logic model, a machine learned fuzzy logic model, a self-organising map model, and a multi-layer perceptron model. Their prediction accuracy is compared with that of two classical approaches: a statistical ARIMA model and an econometric error correction model. The algorithms are evaluated on a complete series of end-month US 10-year Treasury bonds yields and economic indicators from 1986:1 to 2004:12. In terms of prediction accuracy and reliability, the best results are obtained by the three parametric regression algorithms, namely the econometric, the statistical, and the multi-layer perceptron model. Due to the sparseness of the learning data samples, the manual and the automatic fuzzy logic approaches fail to follow with adequate precision the range of variations of the US 10-year Treasury bonds. For similar reasons, the self-organising map model performs unsatisfactorily. Analysis of the results indicates that the econometric model has a slight edge over the statistical and the multi-layer perceptron models. This suggests that pure data-driven induction may not fully capture the complicated mechanisms ruling the changes in interest rates.

Stochastic volatility is the unobserved state in a hidden Markov model (HMM) and can be tracked using Bayesian filtering. However, derivative data can be considered as conditional expectations that are already observed in the market, and which can be used as input to an inverse problem whose solution is an implied conditional density on volatility. Our analysis relies on a specification of the martingale change of measure, which we refer to as separability. This specification has a multiplicative component that behaves like a risk premium on volatility uncertainty in the market. When applied to SPX options data, the estimated model and implied densities produce variance-swap rates that are consistent with the VIX volatility index. The implied densities are relatively stable over time and pick up some of the monthly effects that occur due to the options’ expiration, indicating that the volatility-uncertainty premium could experience cyclic effects due to the maturity date of the options. © 2015 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Filtering; Heston model; HMM; stochastic volatility; volatility risk premium; volatility uncertainty","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-84926101307"

In this study, it is assumed that aggregate consumption follows a hidden Markov regime-switching process and a representative agent infers the current regime, normal regime, or disaster regime, sequentially from the realized path of the past consumption process. In this setting, the fluctuation in the agent's posterior probabilities of the disaster regime augments the volatility of equity returns. By utilizing the stochastic differential utility, this study demonstrates that the current model can help resolve many asset pricing puzzles including the equity premium puzzle, equity volatility puzzle, and risk-free rate puzzle simultaneously. Further, the current model predicts the counter-cyclical pattern in the equity premium and equity-return volatility on the normal regime, although asset returns are negative and highly volatile during disasters. The study also demonstrates that, if the agent's preferences are restricted to time-additive power utility, the consideration of hidden persistent disasters deepens the asset pricing puzzles. © 2013 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg. © 2014 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Asset pricing; Equity premium; Equity volatility; Persistent disasters; Stochastic differential utility","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84905013524"

When firm size is used as the only portfolio grouping variable (Table AI in Fama and French, 1992), the estimated alphas and betas across portfolios are positively related, causing the estimated coefficient of beta to be upwardly biased.

Our paper fills this gap by comparing the predictive ability of technical indicators with that of macroeconomic variables. Technical indicators display statistically and economically significant in-sample and out-of-sample predictive power, matching or exceeding that of macroeconomic variables. Furthermore, technical indicators and macroeconomic variables provide complementary information over the business cycle: technical indicators better detect the typical decline in the equity risk premium near business-cycle peaks, whereas macroeconomic variables more readily pick up the typical rise in the equity risk premium near cyclical troughs. Consistent with this behavior, we show that combining information from both technical indicators and macroeconomic variables significantly improves equity risk premium forecasts versus using either type of information alone.

This method of analytical approximation allows accurate inferences for latent factors, parameters and forecasts in dynamic models with reduced computational cost. In the estimation of dynamic term structure models it also avoids some simplifications in the inference procedures, such as the inefficient two-step ordinary least squares (OLS) estimation. The results obtained in the estimation of the dynamic Nelson-Siegel model indicate that this method performs more accurate out-of-sample forecasts compared to the methods of two-stage estimation by OLS and also Bayesian estimation methods using Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC). These analytical approaches also allow efficient calculation of measures of model selection such as generalized cross-validation and marginal likelihood, which may be computationally prohibitive in MCMC estimations.

Based on these three factors and several macroeconomic variables, VAR models are developed and tested to forecast macroeconomic variables.

Generally, there are two kinds of different effects that support the changing of credit spread: asset allocation effect and credit risk change effect. The existing literature based on US data supports credit spread change is driven by credit risk change; however, this issue based on Chinese market data has not been investigated clearly. This paper seeks to address this issue. Design/methodology/approach – The authors adopt Markov regime switching model to investigate the changing mode of the credit spread in the Chinese bond market. They select three kinds of variables: the credit risk variables, the asset allocation variables and the liquidity condition variables. With ML estimators, the authors can find the changing mode and further they study the relationship between the regime switching and some observed variables, such as macro economy variables and turnover of stock market. Findings – The authors find it is driven by asset allocation effect in most time and by credit risk change only in shorter period. Empirical results show that the switching of dominance from one effect to another isn't closely related with macro-economy variables, but related with the turnover of stock market. Practical implications – These results indicate that in China the credit risk of corporate bonds is relatively low and the corporate bonds are still auxiliary asset for investors. Originality/value – In this paper, the authors have the following two contributions: first, they discuss the asset allocation effect in the Chinese bond market and introduce the stock market variables and bank credit variable to describe the asset allocation effect; second, based on Chinese bond market data, they find different findings from the existing literature about US and European bond markets, showing that the changing of credit spread is mostly related with asset allocation effect but not credit risk change. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Asset allocation effect; Assets; Bonds; China; Credit; Credit risk effect; Credit spread change; Markov regime switching model","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85015670143"

To this end, a post Keynesian endogenous growth model is presented, in which: (1) the desired rate of capital accumulation is assumed to be a nonlinear function of external indebtedness as a share of capital stock; (2) an endogenous country risk premium is assumed to be an increasing (linear) function of external indebtedness (as a share of capital stock); (3) there is a fixed exchange rate regime and perfect capital mobility in the sense of Mundell and Fleming. The main theoretical result of the model is the existence of two long-run equilibrium positions, one of which has a high level of external indebtedness (as a ratio of capital stock) and a low profit rate and the other has a low level of external indebtedness and a high profit rate. This means that ""excessive"" external indebtedness can result in stagnant growth due to its negative effect on the rate of profit. To test the effects of external indebtedness on the rate of economic growth in emerging economies, a dynamic panel is estimated to evaluate whether external debt has an effective negative influence on economic growth in emerging countries. An empirical test of demand-led growth equations with a dynamic panel for fifty-five emerging countries confirms the potential negative effects of external debt on long-term growth rates in the sample countries. © 2013 M.E.

The contribution of this paper is threefold. First, a form of parameter constraints is introduced with an efficient EM algorithm for estimation. Second, an accurate method for computing standard errors is presented for the model with and without parameter constraints. Lastly, a hypothesis-testing approach based on likelihood ratio tests is proposed, which aids in the selection of unnecessary parameters and leads to the greater efficiency at the estimation.

In doing so a set of phenomena has been recognized that is thought to be specific to the PE sector, such as “money-chasing deal phenomenon” (Gompers and Lerner, 2000) and “performance persistence” (Lerner and Schoar, 2005). However, based on their continuing use of an ex-post perspective, few scholars have paid attention to the possible extent to which these and other PE phenomena may affect expected returns from PE investments. To address this problem this article draws on an ex-ante perspective of investment decision-making in suggesting how a number of drivers and factors of PE phenomena may produce “abnormal returns”, and that each of those drivers and factors should therefore be considered in accurately assessing the required risk premium and expected abnormal returns of PE investments. In making these contributions we examined a private equity investment of a regional PE in Italy and administered a telephone questionnaire to 40 PEs in Italy and the UK and found principally that while size is the most important driver in producing abnormal returns illiquidity alone cannot explain the expected returns of PE investments (cf. Franzoni et al., 2012). Based on our findings we developed a predictive model of PE decision-making that draws on an ex-ante perspective of asset pricing and takes into account PE phenomena and abnormal returns. This model extends the work of Franzoni et al. (2012), Jegadeesh et al. (2009), and Korteweg and Sorensen (2010) who did not consider the possible influence of PE phenomena in decision-making and will also help PE managers in making better-informed decisions. © 2018 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Abnormal Returns; Internal Rate of Return; Private Equity Funds; Risk Premium","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Bronze Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-84939419937"

Firstly, we show that the sovereign default risk, which is taken on by investing in high-yield currencies, may increase the magnitude of the gains during the boom periods and the losses during crises. We empirically test for this hypothesis on a sample of 18 emerging currencies over the period from June 2005 to September 2010, the default risk being proxied by the sovereign credit default swap spread. Relying on smooth transition regression (STR) models, we show that default risk contributes to the carry-trade gains during booms, and worsens the losses during busts. Secondly, we turn to the ""Fama regression"" linking the exchange-rate depreciation to the interest-rate differential. We propose a nonlinear estimation of this equation, explaining the puzzling evolution of its coefficient by the change in the market volatility along the financial cycle. Then, we introduce the default risk into this equation and show that the ""forward bias"", usually evidenced by a coefficient smaller than unity in this regression, is somewhat alleviated, as the default risk is significant to explain the exchange-rate change. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Carry trades; Default risk; Smooth transition regression models; UIP puzzle","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84874775246"

The GSG hypothesis argues that the surge in capital inflows from emerging market economies to the United States led to significant declines in long-term interest rates in the United States and other industrial economies. In turn, these lower interest rates, when combined with both innovations and deficiencies of the U.S. credit market, are believed to have contributed to the U.S. housing bubble and to the buildup in financial vulnerabilities that led to the financial crisis. Because the GSG countries for the most part restricted their U.S. purchases to Treasuries and Agency debt, their provision of savings to ultimately risky subprime mortgage borrowers was necessarily indirect, pushing down yields on safe assets and increasing the appetite for alternative investments on the part of other investors. Foreign acquisitions of private-label ABS, primarily by Europeans, provided credit more directly and, by adding to domestic demand for these securities, contributed to the decline in their spreads over Treasury yields. Through a combination of empirical estimation and model simulation, we verify that both GSG inflows into Treasuries and Agencies, as well as European acquisitions of ABS, played a role in contributing to downward pressures on U.S. interest rates. © 2012. © 2012 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Asset-backed securities; Capital flows; Financial crisis; Global saving glut; Interest rates","capital flow; economic development; financial crisis; innovation; interest rate; investment; market conditions; mortgage lending; United States","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-84869885995"

However, the preference models used in most integrated assessment models, including those commonly used to inform climate policy, do not adequately characterize the risk attitudes revealed by typical investment decisions. Here, we adopt an empirical approach to risk preference description using international historical data on investment returns and the occurrence of rare economic disasters. We improve on earlier analyses by employing a hierarchical Bayesian inference procedure that allows for nation-specific estimates of both disaster probabilities and preference parameters. This provides a stronger test of the underlying investment model than provided by previous calibrations and generates some compelling hypotheses for further study. Specifically, results suggest that society is substantially more averse to risk than typically assumed in integrated assessment models. In addition, there appear to be systematic differences in risk preferences among nations. These results are likely to have important implications for policy recommendations: higher aversion to risk increases the precautionary value of taking action to avoid low-probability, high-impact outcomes. However, geographically variable attitudes toward risk indicate that this precautionary value could vary widely across nations, thereby potentially complicating the negotiation of transboundary agreements focused on risk reduction. © 2012 Society for Risk Analysis. © 2013 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.; MEDLINE® is the source for the MeSH terms of this document.","Cost-benefit analysis; Economic catastrophe; Elasticity of marginal utility; Equity risk premium; Hierarchical Bayes","Climate policy; Empirical approach; Hierarchical Bayes; Hierarchical bayesian; Historical data; Integrated assessment; Integrated assessment models; Investment decisions; Investment models; Investment returns; Marginal utility; Preference models; Risk attitude; Risk preference; Risk premium; Risk reductions; Trans-boundary; Bayesian networks; Climate models; Disasters; Elasticity; Inference engines; Investments; Risk perception; assessment method; calibration; catastrophic event; data set; decision making; disaster management; economic analysis; environmental policy; hierarchical system; integrated approach; numerical model; risk factor; article; Bayes theorem; disaster; international cooperation; risk assessment; theoretical model; Bayes Theorem; Internationality; Models, Theoretical; Risk Assessment","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84869495004"

When using price errors, objective function in term structure estimation is a nonlinear function of the model parameters. This necessarily entails using numerical optimization techniques for estimation, which brings to fore the issue of (sensitivity of final results to) the choice of initialization of the optimization routine. This study assesses the sensitivity of the final objective function value and the final parameter vector to the choice of the 'initial guess' during the estimation of the popular Nelson-Siegel model. It turns out that there exist regions in the shape of the objective function where a slight change in (seemingly reasonable) initial vector takes one far from optimum. Choice of the (range of) 'best' starting vector turns out to be an empirical matter. Grid search is recommended. One must first get to a subset of initial values that results in the objective function value near a minimum and then assess the sensitivity of the final parameter vector to those relevant (subset of) initial values.

Significant evidence for time-varying volatility in the yield factors is found.

The second model, ODLV-GARCH, is formulated in terms of observation-driven latent variables; it automatically incorporates a risk premium effect. Both models nest the ordinary threshold t-GARCH as a limiting case. The GHt-GARCH and ODLV-GARCH models are compared with each other and with the threshold t-GARCH using five publicly available asset return data sets, by means of Bayes factors, information criteria, and classical forecast evaluation tools.

Our aim is to illustrate empirically a net of interactions existing among the major bond markets of Europe and the US market taking into account shifts in the underlying stochastic processes. For this purpose, differing from the rest of the relevant empirical literature, after specifying the long run equilibrium relations we estimate the linkages between the bond markets as subject to hidden Markov chains, by applying the Markov Switching Vector Error Correction framework (MS-VECM). This formulation is found to efficiently reflect the shifts brought about by significant economic events, such as the European monetary unification. As a result we illustrate different short-run relations referring to the periods before and after the monetary union. Overall, our empirical results indicate that stronger interactions among the markets of the system exist in the period after the EMU. Also, by means of a variance decomposition analysis we assess leader-follower relations which indicate that the benchmark status of bonds has changed since the introduction of the common monetary policy framework in Europe. © 2010 Blackwell Publishing Ltd. © 2012 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Benchmarks; Bond markets; Financial integration; Markov switching","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84862104145"

We are also able to estimate the average volatility risk premia. We applied our methodology to implied volatilities on eurodollar options, from which we filter the unobserved spot local variance. These data arise from Over The Counter (OTC) transactions that account for high liquidity. For these data, we estimated a positive average volatility risk premia, which is consistent with the Intertemporal Capital Asset Pricing Model (ICAPM) setup of Merton (1973).

We find that at the beginning of EMU, the government debt level and the general investors' risk aversion had a significant impact on interest differentials. In the subsequent years, however, financial markets paid less attention to the fiscal position of a country and the safe haven status of Germany diminished in importance. By the end of 2006, two years before the fall of Lehman Brothers, financial markets began to grant Germany safe haven status again. One year later, when financial turmoil began, the market reaction to fiscal loosening increased considerably.

We employ sensitivity analyses together with a probabilistic analysis to quantify costs for plants with and without CCS under uncertainty or variability in key parameters. Results for new baseload plants indicate a likely increase in levelized cost of electricity (LCOE) of $20-32/MWh (constant 2007$) or $22-40/MWh in current dollars. A risk premium for plants with CCS increases these ranges to $23-39/MWh and $25-46/MWh, respectively. Based on current cost estimates, our analysis further shows that a policy to encourage CCS at new NGCC plants via an emission tax or carbon price requires (at 95% confidence) a price of at least $125/t CO<inf>2</inf> to ensure NGCC-CCS is cheaper than a plant without CCS.

Multi-scale estimators similar to that recently proposed by Zhang (2006) can, in fact, be constructed within a simple regression-based approach by exploiting the linear relation existing between the market microstructure bias and the realized volatilities computed at different frequencies. We show how such a powerful multi-scale regression approach can also be applied in the context of the Zhou [Nonlinear Modelling of High Frequency Financial Time Series, pp. 109-123, 1998] or DST orthogonalization of the observed tick-by-tick returns. Providing a natural orthonormal basis decomposition of observed returns, the DST permits the optimal disentanglement of the volatility signal of the underlying price process from the market microstructure noise. The robustness of the DST approach with respect to the more general dependent structure of the microstructure noise is also shown analytically. The combination of the multi-scale regression approach with DST gives a multi-scale DST realized volatility estimator similar in efficiency to the optimal Cramer-Rao bounds and robust against a wide class of noise contamination and model misspecification. Monte Carlo simulations based on realistic models for price dynamics and market microstructure effects show the superiority of DST estimators over alternative volatility proxies for a wide range of noise-to-signal ratios and different types of noise contamination. Empirical analysis based on six years of tick-by-tick data for the S&P 500 index future, FIB 30, and 30 year U.S. Treasury Bond future confirms the accuracy and robustness of DST estimators for different types of real data. © 2012 Taylor and Francis Group, LLC. © 2012 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Bias correction; High Frequency data; Market microstructure; Realized volatility","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84857188308"

The effects of the downgrade on financial markets have been studied in financial engineering, economics and computational finance, but not in agent-based simulation studies. In this paper, we investigate the effect of the rating system (e.g.: S & P) on asset price fluctuations in the artificial market, which is the agent-based simulation model of the financial market. The rating information is defined as a discrete version of the fundamental value. Four strategies : the noise trader, the fundamentalist, the trend predictor, and the contrarian trader, were assumed in previous studies of the artificial market, plus we assume a new agent called “rating user” which uses the rating value, defined as the discrete value of the fundamental value of an asset. We investigate if the rating user makes the artificial market unstable. First, the simulation results show that kurtosis of an asset price return in the market, without fundamentalists, is higher than without rating users. This suggests the usage of rating information makes the artificial market unstable. The simulation outcomes also suggest volatility continuity of asset price return is stronger in the market without fundamentalists than without rating users. Second, we investigate how two parameters, the update interval and rating length, which control the rating value, makes the market stable. The simulation outcomes show that both standard deviation of asset price return and kurtosis of asset price return becomes smaller as the update interval increases. The standard deviation gets larger and kurtosis of that gets larger with the increasing length of rating. These results imply that the rating information should be updated at short intervals and the length of rating should be moderate to make the artificial market stable. keywords: raing-information, financial market, artificial market, agent-based simulation. © 2012, The Japanese Society for Artificial Intelligence.

The goal of this study is to re-examine the relationship between stock returns and foreign exchange risk. The novelties of this work are: (a) a data set that makes use of daily observations for the measurement of the foreign exchange exposure and volatility of the sample firms and (b) data from a Eurozone country. The methodology we make use in reference to the estimation of the sensitivity of each stock to exchange rate movements is that it allows regressing stock returns against factors controlling for market risk, size, value, momentum, foreign exchange exposure and foreign exchange volatility. Stocks are then classified according to their foreign exchange sensitivity portfolios and the return of a hedge (zero-investment) portfolio is calculated. Next, the abnormal returns of the hedge portfolio are regressed against the return of the factors. Finally, we construct a foreign exchange risk factor in such manner as to obtain a monotonic relation between foreign exchange risk and expected returns. The empirical findings show that the foreign exchange risk is priced in the cross section of the German stock returns over the period 2000-2008. Furthermore, they show that the relationship between returns and foreign exchange sensitivity is nonlinear, but it takes an inverse U-shape and that foreign exchange sensitivity is larger for small size firms and value stocks. © 2011 Elsevier B.V. © 2011 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Asset pricing; Book-to-market ratio; Fama-French; Foreign exchange risk; Market risk premium; Momentum; Size; Volatility","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-79953279666"

(Proceedings of the ACM Conference on Electronic Commerce, 2007). For these markets, we consider subset bettings in which each trader can bet on a subset of candidates ending up in a subset of positions. We consider the revenue maximization problem for the auctioneer in two main frameworks: the risk-free revenue maximization (studied in Chen et al., Proceedings of the ACM Conference on Electronic Commerce, 2007), and the probabilistic revenue maximization. We also explore the use of some certain knowledge or extra information about the possible outcomes of the market. We first show that finding the optimal revenue in the risk-free model for the subset betting problem is inapproximable. This resolves an open question posed by Chen et al. (Proceedings of the ACM Conference on Electronic Commerce, 2007). In order to identify solvable variants of the problem, we propose the singleton betting language which allows traders to bet an arbitrary value on one candidate for one position. For singleton bettings, we first provide a linear-time implementable necessary and sufficient condition for existence of a solution with positive revenue for any possible outcome. Furthermore, we develop an LP-based polynomial-time algorithm to find the optimum solution of this problem. In addition, we show how to extend this LP-based method to handle some extra information about the possible outcomes. Finally, we consider the revenue maximization problem in a probabilistic setting. For this variant, we observe that the problem of maximizing the expected revenue is polynomial-time solvable, but we show that maximizing the probability of achieving a pre-specified revenue is #P-Complete. © 2009 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC. © 2012 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Betting markets; Combinatorial algorithms; Linear programming; Matching markets; Prediction markets; Revenue maximization","Betting markets; Combinatorial algorithm; Matching markets; Prediction markets; Revenue maximization; Algorithms; Electronic commerce; Polynomials; Set theory; Problem solving","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-79959223300"

The model is solved by a nonlinear method. The posterior distribution of the parameters in the model is found to be bi-modal. The degree of nominal rigidity is high at one mode (""sticky price mode"") but is low at the other mode (""flexible price mode""). I find that the degree of nominal rigidity is important for identifying macro shocks that affect the yield curve. When prices are more flexible, a slowly varying inflation target of the central bank is the main driver of the overall level of the yield curve by changing long-run inflation expectations. In contrast, when prices are more sticky, a highly persistent markup shock is the main driver. The posterior probability of each mode is sensitive to the use of observed proxies for inflation expectations. Ignoring additional information from survey data on inflation expectations significantly reduces the posterior probability of the flexible price mode.

First, the authors find that the MO is positively associated with interest rate spread after controlling for the other Japanese ownership structure, cross-shareholdings, and the stable shareholdings by financial institutions. Second, by employing factor analysis to measure the agency cost of debt (ACD) based on financial variables, the authors also find that MO has higher correlation with interest rate spread when the ACD at the time of bond issue is already larger. The results are robust to additional analyses, including the possibility of nonlinear relationship, bond rating, endogeneity problem, and Fama and MacBeth approach. The results suggest that prospective bondholders use MO information to anticipate a firm's future ACD and estimate it higher when the current ACD at issuing bond is already larger. The results also suggest that accounting information is useful to estimate the ACD and increase the efficiency of bond contracting. Finally, although previous studies are often prone to emphasizing the findings on the Japanese unique ownership structure, the results of this article reveal that traditional agency theory on MO apply to Japanese bond market, which is consistent with the findings of U.S. firms. © The Author(s) 2011. © 2011 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Agency cost of debt; Bond yield spread; Managerial ownership","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-81255200514"

In this paper the question, what specific HJM model is consistent with the observed price of an Eurodollar Futures contract? is discussed. Eurodollar Futures, apart from being the most heavily traded futures are connected to London Inter Bank Offered Rate (LIBOR) and to domestic monetary conditions. The answer to the above question will help in pricing any new derivative on Eurodollar Futures or the one that is not heavily traded. A simple tool to measure the adequacy of different HJM structures that may be used to model Eurodollar Futures price process is suggested. Moreover, the question of estimation of parameters of these models by different methods-method of realized volatility, method of maximum likelihood (ML) and a two-stage method that combines both the realized volatility and ML-is addressed. Although it sounds like a typical statistical procedure, one must be careful in applying standard statistical techniques that are not suitable under arbitrage theory, in particular, ML method.

The purpose of developing the framework is twofold: (1) to draw attention to important yet under-researched aspects of ethical decision-making, and (2) to increase our understanding of the psychology of committing fraud. Our framework builds on the existing fraud triangle (PCAOB, Consideration of fraud in a financial statement audit. AU Section 316, www.pcaobus.org, 2005) which is used by auditors to assess fraud risk. The fraud triangle is composed of three factors that, together, predict the likelihood of fraud within an organization: opportunity, incentive/pressure, and attitude/rationalization. We find that, when faced with the opportunity and incentive/pressure, there are three psychological pathways to fraud nestled within attitude/rationalization: (1) lack of awareness, (2) intuition coupled with rationalization, and (3) reasoning. These distinctions are important for fraud prevention because each of these paths is driven by a different psychological mechanism. This framework is useful in a number of ways. First, it identifies certain insidious situational factors in which individuals commit fraud without recognizing it. Second, it extends our knowledge of rationalization by theorizing that individuals use rationalization to avoid or reduce the negative affect that accompanies performing an unethical behavior. Negative affect is important because individuals wish to avoid it. Third, it identifies several other methods fraudsters use to reduce negative affect, each of which could serve as potential ""psychological red flags"" and helps predict future fraudulent behavior. Finally, our framework can be used as a theoretical foundation to explore several interventions designed to prevent fraud. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media B.V. © 2011 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","fraud; fraud triangle; moral intuition; negative affect; normalization; rationalization","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-79960729737"

In order to manage the risk borne by annuity providers, one needs to take into account all sources of uncertainty that affect the value of future obligations under the contract. In this paper, we define the concept of annuity rate as the conditional expected present value random variable of future payments of the annuity, given the future dynamics of its risk factors. The annuity rate deals with the non-diversifiable systematic risk contained in the life annuity contract, and it involves mortality risk as well as investment risk. While it is plausible to assume that there is no correlation between the two risks, each affects the annuity rate through a combination of dependent random variables. In order to understand the probabilistic profile of the annuity rate, we apply comonotonicity theory to approximate its quantile function. We also derive accurate upper and lower bounds for prediction intervals for annuity rates. We use the Lee-Carter model for mortality risk and the Vasicek model for the term structure of interest rates with an annually renewable fixed-income investment policy.

We find that obstacles to successful fluoridation include a unidimensional policy space, high risk premia assigned by the affected population to health and environmental hazards, concerns over government interference with personal health choices, perceived adequacy of fluoride sources, ""customer bundling,"" and lack of a critical middle ground for consensus-building. The accessibility and social desirability of merit goods, like fluoridated water, cannot therefore be considered as value-free choices.

It is underlined that statistics must show explicitly ‘the height of technological leap’ and provide separate parameters of old and new technologies. And that the current focusing of attention on the most advanced technologies only should be broadened to all technologies which actually are being implementing in the economy. Comparison with the Cambridge Multisectoral Dynamic Model of the British Economy shows how peculiarities of reflection of new technologies could affect ability of seeing turning points.

Methodology/approach - To test this hypothesis, the chapter uses the residuals of the trend relationship among housing wealth and labor income to predict both stock returns and government bond yields. Specifically, it shows that nonlinear deviations of housing wealth from its cointegrating relationship with labor income, hwy, forecast expected future returns. Findings - Using data for a set of industrialized countries, the chapter finds that when the housing wealth-to-income ratio falls, investors demand a higher risk premium for stocks. As for government bond returns: (i) when they are seen as a component of asset wealth, investors react in the same manner and (ii) if, however, investors perceive the increase in government bond returns as signaling a future rise in taxes or a deterioration of public finances, then they interpret the fall in the housing wealth-to-income ratio as a fall in future bond premia. Finally, this work shows that the occurrence of crisis episodes amplifies the transmission of housing market shocks to financial markets. Originality/value of chapter - These findings are novel. They also open new and challenging avenues for understanding the dynamics of the relationship between the housing sector, stock market and government bond developments, and the banking system.

The strategy involves two steps. First, an accounting-based probabilistic prediction model of changes in the medium-term book return on owners' equity (ROE) is estimated. Second, market expectations of changes in medium-term ROE are assessed through observed stock prices and the residual income valuation model. Stock market positions over 36-month holding periods are taken when the accounting-based predictions of ROE and the market expectations differ. Over the period 1983-2003, the investment strategy generated values of Jensen's alpha corresponding to an average monthly excess return for a hedge position of up to 0.8% for a sample of manufacturing companies. In the main this hedge return was caused by strong positive returns to the long positions, and additional analyses show that the returns appear to have been affected by a positive market sentiment bias (i.e., positive ROE surprises being associated with stronger price reactions than negative ROE surprises) making out-of-sample inferences somewhat dubious. Furthermore, most of the investment returns accrued over holding periods up to around 1995, with no indications of market mispricing over the last third (1995-2003) of the investment period. The empirical results are consistent with market investors having become more sophisticated in their use of publicly available accounting information over time. © 2010 The Authors.

Focusing on the interaction between the call and default options, they note that the existence of one option delays the exercise of the other. This has strong empirical implications for duration and for the determinants of yield spread changes. For duration, when considered separately, both default and call shorten duration. However, when the interaction between the two risks is also accounted for, it is shown to lengthen duration. Since duration is equivalent to the interest-rate elasticity of the bond, the above analysis is also important for the interest-rate sensitivity of the bond yield spread. Sarkar and Hong [2004] also derive a structural model for pricing a fixed-price callable and defaultable bond, and their model has similar implications to that of Acharya and Carpenter [2002]. In this article we test the main implications of these theoretical models. In particular, we test the interest-rate elasticity of the call spread and that of the default spread, allowing for interaction between both spreads. We also examine the impact of both risks and their interaction on the effective duration of corporate bonds. In our tests we examine both bonds carrying a fixed-price call option and those carrying the newer and more popular makewhole option. We find evidence supporting the predictions of the two models. First, our data show a statistically significant interaction between default spreads and call spreads. Second, as the theory predicts, we show that, when considered separately, both default and call risks shorten duration for fixed-price callable bonds. When both risks are considered together, in general we find that the interaction term lengthens the effective duration of callable defaultable bonds. This finding is in agreement with the theory. The implication of our findings is that portfolio managers of callable corporate bonds, who use duration as an immunization tool or practice active rate anticipation strategies, must pay attention to the maturity of the bond. For example, it is clear that no risk adjustment is necessary when one manages A rated make-whole callable bonds with short and medium maturities. However, it is important to consider not only the impacts of default and call risks on estimating duration but also the interaction between these variables when one manages callable debt of all other maturities. We repeat our tests for bond portfolios stratified by ratings. In general, the results for the portfolios are also in agreement with the implications of the Acharya and Carpenter [2002] model. Another prediction made by Acharya and Carpenter is that both the noncallable and callable bonds' sensitivity to firm value decrease. For noncallable bonds, we find that the default spread's sensitivity to equity return is much greater for BBB rated bonds compared with AA and A rated bonds. Acharya and Carpenter [2002] also argue that callable bond's sensitivity to firm value is lower than that of a noncallable bond. In general, our results support this theoretical prediction, especially for make-whole bonds. The models of Acharya and Carpenter [2002] and Sarkar and Hong [2004] focus on pricing fixed-price callable bonds. However, the make-whole call provision became the standard for callable bonds in recent years, both in the U.S. and Canada. Powers and Tsyplakov [2004] derive a structural model for pricing make-whole callable bonds. Their model does not allow the study of duration similar to that of Acharya and Carpenter [2002] and Sarkar and Hong [2004]. Given the popularity of make-whole bonds, a possible direction for future research is the introduction of a structural bond-pricing model that allows studying the duration and yield-spread elasticity of these bonds. © 2010 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-77957848360"

The purpose of this paper is to provide new empirical evidence on these two inter-related issues, which are critical to investors and corporate risk management. Design/methodology/approach – This paper applies two different econometric approaches: Nonlinear Seemingly Unrelated Regression (NLSUR) via Hansen's Generalized Method of Moment (GMM) and multivariate GARCH in mean (MGARCH-M) to examine the exchange rate exposure and its pricing. Findings – Using industry data for Japan, similar to previous studies, foreign exchange risk is not priced based on the test of an unconditional two-factor asset pricing model. However, strong evidence of time-varying foreign exchange risk premium and significant exchange rate betas are obtained based on the tests of conditional asset pricing models using MGARCH-M approach where both conditional first and second moments of industry returns and risk factors are estimated simultaneously. Research limitations/implications – The strong empirical evidence found in this study implies that corporate currency hedging not only results in more stable cash flows for a firm, but also reduces its cost of capital, and hence is justifiable. Originality/value – This paper conducts an in-depth investigation regarding the exchange rate exposure and its pricing by utilizing two different econometric approaches: NLSUR via Hansen's GMM and MGARCH-M.

Under the historical distribution, our approach accommodates nonlinear (nonaffine) processes while leading to closed-form expressions for the conditional likelihood functions for zero-coupon bond yields. As motivation for our framework, we show that it encompasses many of the equilibrium models with habit-based preferences or recursive preferences and long-run risks. We illustrate our methods by constructing maximum likelihood estimates of a nonlinear discrete-time DTSM with habit-based preferences in which bond prices are known in closed form.

The research examines the broader question of whether sponsorship has the potential to transcend cultural boundaries and contribute to financial performance in regional markets. Design/methodology/approach – The methodology is based on the event study technique which is applied to the estimation of excess returns that arise in response to announcements of corporate sponsorship made by leading industrial stocks trading on the Australian Stock Exchange. Regressions examine whether the cost and duration of sponsorship signal information of importance to investors regarding the financial prospects of sponsoring firms. Findings – A small, fleeting positive increase in wealth effects is observed indicating that economically, sponsorship expenditure in Australia is more or less value neutral. While investors appear indifferent to sponsorship cost, they value shortterm sponsorships of less than two years in particular. Research limitations/implications – Future research needs to examine the role of associated variables such as contract size and length, and the type and level of sponsorship investment. Originality/value – For firms, the study indicates that sponsorship in smaller regional markets should be valued by investors especially when firms keep the duration of the sponsorship as short. As stock prices tend to rise briefly following sponsorship announcements, marketers should leverage sponsorships immediately to gain the attention of investors. For a regional market, short and sharp sponsorships appear to be the optimal approach. © 2010, Emerald Group Publishing Limited © 2016 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Australia; Financial performance; Sponsorship; Stock prices","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-77958474981"

For example, in modeling for interest rates, the Vasicek model asserts that the term structure of interest rate is not just a single process, but rather a superposition of several analogous processes. This motivates us to develop an improved estimation theory for the drift parameters when homogeneity of several parameters may hold. However, the information regarding the equality of these parameters may be imprecise. In this context, we consider Stein-rule (or shrinkage) estimators that allow us to improve on the performance of the classical maximum likelihood estimator (MLE). Under an asymptotic distributional quadratic risk criterion, their relative dominance is explored and assessed. We illustrate the suggested methods by analyzing interbank interest rates of three European countries. Further, a simulation study illustrates the behavior of the suggested method for observation periods of small and moderate lengths of time.

The growing presence of financial operators in the oil markets has led to the diffusion of trading techniques based on extrapolative expectations. Strategies of this kind foster feedback trading that may cause considerable departures of prices from their fundamental values. We investigate this hypothesis using a modified CAPM following Shiller (1984) and Sentana and Wadhwani (1992). First, a univariate GARCH(1,1)-M is estimated assuming the risk premium to be a function of the conditional oil price volatility. The single factor model, however, is outperformed by the multifactor ICAPM (Merton, 1973), which takes into account a larger investment opportunity set. Analysis is then carried out using a trivariate CCC GARCH-M model with complex nonlinear conditional mean equations where oil price dynamics are associated with both stock market and exchange rate behavior. We find strong evidence that oil price shifts are negatively related to stock price and exchange rate changes and that a complex web of time-varying first and second order conditional moment interactions affects both the CAPM and feedback trading components of the model. Despite the difficulties, we identify a significant role played by speculation in the oil market, which is consistent with the observed large daily upward and downward shifts in prices - a clear evidence that it is not a fundamental-driven market. Thus, from a policy point of view - given the impact of volatile oil prices on global inflation and growth - actions that monitor speculative activities on commodity markets more effectively are to be welcomed. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.

Previous applications of DP to optimize pipeline long-range facility planning problems based on either the least-cost path for the facility or the most-probable path for noncost constraints have been documented in the literature. Such applications, however, are faced with a challenge in selecting the optimum facility deployment path, as the least-cost path does not always necessarily coincide with the most-probable path. As a result, the selection of a path that combines both features has to be achieved through a subjective compromise and in a rather arbitrary manner. In the present paper, two new DP methods have been developed which are based on the concept of combining cost and probability to give a single-objective probability-adjusted cost. One method incorporated the probability of each arc in the DP architecture using a variation of the Black-Scholes partial differential equation. The solution of the resulting equation gave a probability-adjusted arc cost dependent on the year (or stage) the cost incurred, the overall probability of all constraints associated with this arc, and the risk-free rate. The other method was based on simply dividing the present value of each arc cost by its probability to give a single probability-adjusted cost. Both approaches were applied to a complex DP architecture composed of 10 stages and 10 different options at each stage in which all options were available at every stage in a directed manner. The optimum paths from the new approaches were compared to the least-cost options, and most-probable options, and were found to combine the two features. Finally, all options from all methods were found to lie on a Pareto front obtained from a multiobjective genetic algorithm. © 2010 ASCE. © 2011 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Dynamic programming; Forecasting; Pipeline; Planning","Arc costs; Black-Scholes partial differential equations; Facility planning; Least-cost paths; Multi-objective genetic algorithm; Pareto front; Planning algorithms; Present value; Risk-free rate; Algorithms; Costs; Feature extraction; Forecasting; Optimization; Partial differential equations; Pipelines; Planning; Probability; Stages; Dynamic programming","Article","Final","All Open Access; Bronze Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-82355181547"

By the end of the summer of 1851, it had gradually annulled most of the democratic gains of the revolution and with the two New Year's Eve Patents abolished the previously granted ""paper"" Constitution and the Citizens' Rights Act at the end of 1851. With the Amendment to the Penal Code of 1852, it introduced drastic penalties for political offences and established complete control of the press with the new Press Act (1852). Political repression came together with a series of important reform measures on which the monarchy (the Cisleithania) stood until its end. Besides setting up a modern administration and legislature, local self-management (municipalities) and modernizing secondary and higher education, the regime strived in particular to bring the economy back to life. By dissolving the customs border with Hungary in 1851, relatively quickly abandoning agrarian reform (1853-55) and protectionism, and by investing state money in the construction of transport infrastructure (the construction of the Southern Railway), it tried to dynamize the Austrian economy and increase the prosperity of its citizens. However, his economic policy had no significant short-term results. On the contrary, the costly maintenance for the enormous state apparatus and the army resulted in an ever greater hole in the treasury. The implementation of agrarian reform only insignificantly sped up the development of the agrarian sector, which hindered faster industrialization. After the outbreak of a global economic crisis in 1857, the main industry sectors (steelworks, mining and construction) found themselves in a very difficult situation. The regime systematically encouraged economic optimism. Newspapers plied the citizens with data about miraculous crops and forecast a golden era flowing with milk and honey. However, the government predictions did not materialize. Only a small circle of people benefited from the new economic policy. The rural population, which accounted for approximately 88% of the total population, was overburdened with high taxes and with payments on the agrarian reform installments as well as the ""voluntary"" people's loan that had been imposed on them in 1854. Those hit by the rising prices of necessities of life (as a result of poor crop yield) included the lower social strata in towns, who had already been confronted with mass unemployment after the outbreak of the crisis in 1857. Public servants also found themselves in a difficult position because of meager salaries. The reports that were submitted by the district boards (i.e. district offices) to the regional governments about people's political disposition showed a difficult economic and social situation (high taxes) to have been the main generator of popular rural discontent with the regime. Rural critique was aimed at the local representatives of the regime (clerks, police officers and the army), who personified the state at the local level, but also at the emperor, who obviously was not very popular at the beginning of his career. Additionally, the lower social strata in towns were often very critical about absolutism. In the first half of the 1850s, it was Maribor in particular that was considered almost as a republican stronghold. On the other hand, townspeople were much more cautious in expressing their political views. According to the reports, townspeople were more interested in the foreign policy (the Crimean War, the ""anti-Austrian"" policy of Napoleon III) than in the internal political problems. With respect to the latter, they only occasionally responded to the announced craftsmanship freedom (which the craftsmen themselves opposed) and the conclusion of the concordat (1855), which, however, did not receive any significant attention in Slovenia. (The Styrian deputy's reports to his police chief Kempen only mention agitation among students and individual townspeople in Graz with respect to the concordat. It is interesting that none of the reports (neither for the rural nor the urban areas) mentions any national tensions up to 1859. © 2018 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","","","Review","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85042775821"

A real-options algorithm has been created for this task. Constant interest rates incorporating high risk premium have been extensively used for economic calculations, within the framework of traditional direct cash flow methods, thus favouring immediate, irreversible investments in the expense of, sometimes, insubstantially low anticipated yields. In this article, not only incomes and expenses but also interest and inflation rates are considered stochastically evolving according to specific probabilistic models. The numerical experiments indicated that the stochastic interest rate forecasts fluctuate in such low levels that may signal delayed investment entry in favour of higher expected yields. The implementation of stochastically evolving interest rates in energy investment analysis may have a controversial effect on sustainability. Displacements of inefficient plants may be significantly delayed, thus prolonging high CO<inf>2</inf> emission rates. Under the current CO<inf>2</inf> allowance prices or their medium-term forecasts, this situation may not be improved and flexible policy interventions may be necessitated. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

Of considerable current interest are models of the yield curve in which a collection of observed and latent factors determine the market price of factor risks, the stochastic discount factor, and the arbitrage - free bond prices. The model is particularly interesting from a statistical perspective, because the yields are complicated nonlinear functions of the underlying parameters (e.g., those appearing in the evolution dynamics of the factors and those appearing in the model of the factor risks). This nonlinearity tends to produce a likelihood function that is multimodal. In this article we revisit the question of how such models should be fit from the Bayesian viewpoint. Key aspects of the inferential framework include (a) a prior on the parameters of the model that is motivated by economic considerations, in particular, those involving the slope of the implied yield curve; (b) posterior simulation of the parameters in ways to improve the efficiency of the MCMC output, for example, through sampling of the parameters marginalized over the factors and tailoring of the proposal densities in the Metropolis - Hastings steps using information about the mode and curvature of the current target based on the output of a simulating annealing algorithm; and (c) measures to mitigate numerical instabilities in the fitting through reparameterizations and square root filtering recursions. We apply the techniques to explain the monthly yields on nine U.S. Treasury Bills (with maturities ranging from 1 month to 120 months) over the period January 1986 - December 2005. The model contains three factors, one latent and two observed. We also consider the problem of predicting the nine yields for each month of 2006. We show that the (multi-step-ahead) prediction regions properly bracket the actual yields in those months, thus highlighting the practical value of the fitted model. © 2009 American Statistical Association. © 2012 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Bayesian analysis; Forecasting; Kalman filtering; Markov chain Monte Carlo; Metropolis-Hastings algorithm; Noarbitrage condition; Simulated annealing; Square root filter; Tailored proposal density; Term structure; Zero-coupon bond","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-74049132711"

Given its importance, it is surprising that more attention has not been paid in practical terms to estimation issues. In this paper, we began by looking at the determinants of equity risk premiums including macro economic volatility, investor risk aversion and behavioral components. We then looked at the three basic approaches used to estimate equity risk premiums - the survey approach, where investors or managers are asked to provide estimates of the equity risk premium for the future, the historical return approach, where the premium is based upon how well equities have done in the past and the implied approach, where we use future cash flows or observed bond default spreads to estimate the current equity risk premium. The premiums we estimate can vary widely across approaches, and we considered two questions towards the end of the paper. The first is why the numbers vary across approaches and the second is how to choose the right number to use in analysis. For the latter question, we argued that the choice of a premium will depend upon the forecast period, whether your believe markets are efficient and whether you are required to be market neutral in your analysis. © 2009 New York University Salomon Center and Wiley Periodicals, Inc. © 2012 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-72149127876"

Zhang and Cheng [M.-H. Zhang, Q.-S. Cheng, An Approach to VaR for capital markets with Gaussian mixture, Applied Mathematics and Computation 168 (2005) 1079-1085] proposed an approach to VaR for daily returns based on Gaussian mixtures, which have become rather popular in empirical economics and finance since the seminal paper of Hamilton [J.D. Hamilton, A new approach to the economic analysis of nonstationary time series and the business cycle, Econometrica 57 (2) (1989) 357-384]. However, they do not conduct tests to assess the accuracy of the mixture-implied VaR measures. Recently, Guidolin and Timmermann [M. Guidolin, A. Timmermann, Term structure of risk under alternative econometric specifications, Journal of Econometrics, 131 (2006) 285-308] showed that Markov mixture models do well in measuring VaR at a monthly frequency, but the results may not hold for daily returns due to their more pronounced non-Gaussian features. This paper provides an extensive application of various Markov mixture models to VaR for daily returns of major European stock markets, including out-of-sample backtesting. To accommodate the properties of daily returns, we consider both Gaussian and Student's t mixtures, and we compare the performance of both uni- and multivariate models under different parameter updating schemes. We find that a univariate mixture of two Student's t distributions performs best overall. However, by the example of the recent turmoil in financial markets, we also highlight a weak point of the approach. © 2009 Elsevier Inc.

One criticism of these conclusions is that these benchmarks are ill suited to handle the extreme statistical nature of option returns generated by nonlinear payoffs. We propose an alternative way to evaluate the statistical significance of option returns by comparing historical statistics to those generated by option pricing models. The most puzzling finding in the existing literature, the large returns to writing out-of-the-money puts, is not inconsistent (i.e., is statistically insignificant) relative to the Black-Scholes model or the Heston stochastic volatility model due to the extreme sampling uncertainty associated with put returns. This sampling problem can largely be alleviated by analyzing market-neutral portfolios such as straddles or delta-hedged returns.

The same questions are posed regarding a possible natural rate of inflation along with an investigation of the actual relationship between inflation and unemployment for which extent theories differ. Time series of unemployment and inflation for US data 1948-2008 were analyzed using the exponential model series and nonlinear regression for capturing Lyapunov exponents and transfer effects from other variables. The best explanation for unemployment was that it is a chaotic variable that is driven in part by inflation. The best explanation for inflation is that it is also a chaotic variable driven in part by unemployment and the prices of treasury bills.

In the literature, the preferred choice of estimator is usually maximum likelihood (ML). ML has strong asymptotic justification but is not necessarily the best method in finite samples. This paper proposes a simulation-based method. When it is used in connection with ML, it can improve the finite-sample performance of the ML estimator while maintaining its good asymptotic properties. The method is implemented and evaluated here in the Black-Scholes option pricing model and in the Vasicek bond and bond option pricing model. It is especially favored when the bias in ML is large due to strong persistence in the data or strong nonlinearity in pricing functions. Monte Carlo studies show that the proposed procedures achieve bias reductions over ML estimation in pricing contingent claims when ML is biased. The bias reductions are sometimes accompanied by reductions in variance. Empirical applications to U.S. Treasury bills highlight the differences between the bond prices implied by the simulation-based approach and those delivered by ML. Some consequences for the statistical testing of contingent-claim pricing models are discussed. © 2012 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-71949112969"

The analysis is based on an adaptive nonparametric modelling approach which allows for the data-driven estimation of the nonlinear dynamic relationship between portfolio credit risk premia and their hypothetical components. Our main finding is that the empirical weights of the systematic factors display sudden jumps during market crises and a less intense time-dependent behaviour during normal market conditions. In addition, we find that during market crises the directions of the empirical relationships are often inconsistent with ordinary economic intuition, as they are influenced by the specific circumstances of financial markets distress. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.

This area opens a possibility of including a dynamic component in behavioural scoring modelling which enables making decisions related to limit, collection and recovery strategies, retention and attrition, as well as providing an insight into the profitability, pricing or term structure of the loan. In this paper, we compare survival analysis and neural networks in terms of modelling and results. The neural network architecture is designed such that its output is comparable to the survival analysis output. Six neural network models were created, one for each period of default. A radial basis neural network algorithm was used to test all six models. The survival model used a Cox modelling procedure. Further, different performance measures of all models were discussed since even in highly accurate scoring models, misclassification patterns appear. A systematic comparison '3 + 2 + 2' procedure is suggested to find the most effective model for a bank. Additionally, the survival analysis model is compared to neural network models according to the relative importance of different variables in predicting the time to default. Although different models can have very similar performance measures they may consist of different variables. The dataset used for the research was collected from a Croatian bank and credit customers were observed during a 12-month period.

In this paper we consider the general case, when exchange rate evolves according to arbitrary one-dimensional diffusion process with local volatility that is the function of time and the current exchange rate and where the domestic and foreign currency risk-free interest rates may be arbitrary continuous functions of time. First non-trivial problem we encounter in time-dependent case is the continuity in time argument of the value function of the American put option and the regularity properties of the optimal exercise boundary. We establish these properties based on systematic use of the monotonicity in volatility for the value functions of the American as well as European options with convex payoffs together with the Dynamic Programming Principle and we obtain certain type of comparison result for the value functions and corresponding exercise boundaries for the American puts with different strikes, maturities and volatilities. Starting from the latter fact that the optimal exercise boundary curve is left continuous with right-hand limits we give a mathematically rigorous and transparent derivation of the significant early exercise premium representation for the value function of the American foreign exchange put option as the sum of the European put option value function and the early exercise premium. The proof essentially relies on the particular property of the stochastic integral with respect to arbitrary continuous semimartingale over the predictable subsets of its zeros. We derive from the latter the nonlinear integral equation for the optimal exercise boundary which can be studied by numerical methods. © 2008 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC. © 2012 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","American put option; Early exercise premium representation; Optimal exercise boundary; Optimal stopping; Snell envelope; Time-dependent model; Zeros of semimartingales","American put option; Early exercise premium representation; Optimal exercise boundary; Optimal stopping; Snell envelope; Time-dependent model; Zeros of semimartingales; Diffusion; Economics; Nonlinear equations; Numerical methods; Optimization; Systems engineering; Dynamic programming","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-63049128694"

We have derived our motivation for building such a system design from behavioral finance research. Analyses of the behavior of individual investors provide evidence that this segment does react more significantly to any public news published compared to institutional investors. On the other hand, the analyses show that they react significantly slower than their institutional counterparts. Since empirical intraday event study analyses show that capital markets react promptly to new information and that excess returns decrease over a specific period of time, individual investors miss significant trading opportunities due to their current strategies of information research. We address the problem that this market segment is not able to continuously observe diverse information channels and to assess all the new information available. Our prototype decision support system continuously observes company announcements and forecasts their potential impact on the corresponding stock price. After identifying those events for which significant market reactions can be expected, wireless push-based message services provide the technical basis for prompt and location-independent information supply. Based on a novel simulation-based evaluation methodology we have developed, we demonstrate and quantify the advantages that the developed system provides to the individual investors. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.

We identify a regime in which both premia are jointly characterized by low volatility and another regime in which both premia are characterized by high volatility. The occurrence of the high volatility regime chronologically coincides with major changes in the pound exchange rate. The low volatility regime has a higher probability of turning up over two consecutive years than the high volatility regime, but it is not perceived by investors to be an absorbing regime. The lagged maturity premium is a strong predictor of the equity risk premium only in the regime of low volatility. In addition, the lagged equity premium is a predictor of the maturity premium also in the low volatility regime. This result on regime-dependent bidirectional predictability is robust to alternative definitions of the equity premium, and to the inclusion of real interest rate and real growth effects. © 2008 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC. © 2009 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Equity Risk Premium; Government Bond Maturity Premium; Nonlinearity; Predictability; Stochastic Regimes","","Review","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-65249147174"

The most popular techniques adjust parsimonious functional forms based on bond yields to maturity.

Multiparous cows with isolation of Staph. aureus in at least 1 quarter produced 94161 kg less milk in 2nd and >3rd parity, respectively, and those with isolation in more than 2 quarters produced 303390 kg less than multiparous culture-negative animals during a 305-d lactation. Compared with culture-negative cows, the hazard ratio for CM and culling in cows with isolation of Staph. aureus in at least 1 quarter was 20 (1624) and 17 (1519), respectively. There was a decrease in the SCC and in the CM risk in culture-negative cows where iodine PMTD had been used, indicating that iodine PMTD has a preventive effect on already healthy cows. For cows testing positive for Staph. aureus in more than 2 quarters at calving, iodine PMTD had a negative effect on the CM risk and on the SCC through the remaining lactation. © 2008 Proprietors of Journal of Dairy Research 2008. © 2009 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Clinical mastitis; Culling; Milk yield; Somatic cell count; Staphylococcus aureus","Animalia; Staphylococcus aureus; animal; animal disease; article; cattle; cattle disease; cell count; cytology; female; lactation; microbiology; milk; physiology; puerperium; Staphylococcus infection; time; Animals; Cattle; Cell Count; Female; Lactation; Mastitis, Bovine; Milk; Postpartum Period; Staphylococcal Infections; Time Factors","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-61849171892"

The relationship is particularly ambiguous within a GARCH-M framework. This paper demonstrates that such a conflict can be attributed primarily to the downward bias of standard estimators that neglect additive outliers (AO) commonly observed in financial returns, and proposes a feasible estimation method (RGMME) for the GARCH-M model based upon a robust variant of the GMM. Monte Carlo experiments demonstrate that AOs cause more serious bias in the ML and GMM estimates of the relationship coefficient than previously expected. Therefore, in the presence of AOs, the RGMME appears superior to other standard estimators in terms of the root mean square error criterion. There is strong evidence favouring the RGMME over standard estimators based on its empirical application. In particular, it is substantially evident from the results of the RGMME that there is support for a positive relationship between excess returns and conditional volatility for all three major equity markets. © 2009 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Additive outliers; Finite-sample bias; GARCH-M model; Risk premium; Risk-return relationship; Robust GMM estimation","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-61449224631"

In this paper we conduct a series of numerical simulation experiments to investigate the quantitative significance of climate response uncertainty for economic assessments of climate change. First we characterize climate uncertainty by constructing two probability density functions-a Bayesian model-averaged and a Bayesian updated version-based on a combination of uncertainty ranges for climate sensitivity reported in the scientific literature. Next we estimate the willingness to pay of a representative agent for a range of emissions reduction policies using two simplified economic models. Our results illustrate the potential for large risk premiums in benefits estimates as suggested by the recent theoretical work on climate response uncertainty, and they show that the size and even the sign of the risk premium may depend crucially on how the posterior distribution describing the overall climate sensitivity uncertainty is constructed and on the specific shape of the damage function. © United States Environmental Protection Agency 2009. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Catastrophe; Climate change; Climate sensitivity; Uncertainty","Bayesian networks; Climate models; Economics; Emission control; Gas emissions; Greenhouse effect; Greenhouse gases; Probability density function; Uncertainty analysis; Atmospheric greenhouse; Catastrophe; Climate change policies; Climate sensitivity; Greenhouse gas emissions reductions; Numerical simulation experiment; Posterior distributions; Uncertainty; Climate change; Bayesian analysis; catastrophe theory; climate change; environmental economics; environmental protection; greenhouse gas; willingness to pay","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-76149142167"

Amino acid side chains located near the capsid intersubunit interfaces and either predicted or found to be dispensable for infectivity were replaced by others that could establish new disulfide bonds or electrostatic interactions between subunits. Two engineered viruses were normally infectious, genetically stable, and antigenically indistinguishable from the natural virus but showed substantially increased stability against irreversible dissociation. Electrostatic interactions mediated this stabilizing effect. For foot-and-mouth disease virus and other viruses, some evidence had suggested that an increase in virion stability could be linked to an impairment of infectivity. The results of the present study show, in fact, that virion thermostability against dissociation into subunits may not be selectively constrained by functional requirements for infectivity. The thermostable viruses obtained, and others similarly engineered, could be used for the production, using current procedures, of foot-and-mouth disease vaccines that are less dependent on a faultless cold chain. In addition, introduction of those stabilizing mutations in empty (nucleic acid-free) capsids could facilitate the production of infection-risk-free vaccines against the disease, one of the economically most important animal diseases worldwide.

Empirical studies using either the proxy approach or the VR method conclude that barrier-independent models significantly underestimate corporate bond yields. Although barrier-dependent models tend to overestimate the yield on average, they generate a sizable degree of underestimation. The present paper shows that the proxy approach is an upwardly biased estimator of the corporate assets and makes the empirical framework work systematically against structural models of corporate bond pricing. The VR approach may generate inconsistent corporate bond prices or may fail to give a positive corporate bond price for some structural models. When the Merton, LS, BD and LT models are implemented with ML estimation, we find substantial improvement in their performances. Our empirical analysis shows that the LT model is very accurate for predicting short-term bond yields, whereas the LS and BD models are good predictors for medium-term and long-term bonds. The Merton model however significantly overestimates short-term bond yields and underestimates long-term bond yields. Unlike empirical studies in the past, the Merton model implemented with ML estimation does not consistently underestimate corporate bond yields. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.

In this approach, an investment model is considered where the agent decides at every time step the proportion of wealth to invest in a risky asset, keeping the rest of the budget in a risk-free asset. Every investment is evaluated in the market via stylized return on investment function (RoI), which is modeled by a stochastic process with unknown periodicities and levels of noise. For comparison, two reference strategies are presented which represent the case of agents with zero knowledge and complete knowledge of the dynamics of the returns. An investment strategy based on technical analysis to forecast the next return is also considered. To account for the performance of the different strategies, some computer experiments are performed to calculate the average budget that can be obtained with them over a certain number of time steps. To assure fair comparisons, the parameters of each strategy are first tuned for budget maximization. Afterward, the performance of these strategies is compared for RoI's with different periodicities and levels of noise. © 2008 World Scientific Publishing Company. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Genetic algorithms; Investment strategies; Portfolio optimization; Time series","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-57249084067"

The reason is that financial time series are complex, non stationary. Furthermore, it is also very difficult to predict this movement with parametric models. Instead of parametric models, we propose two techniques, which are data driven and non parametric. Based on the idea that excess returns would be possible with publicly available information, we developed two models in order to forecast the short term price movements by using technical indicators. Our assumption is that the future value of a stock price depends on the financial indicators although there is no parametric model to explain this relationship.

Comparison shows that support vector regression (SVR) out performs the multi layer perceptron (MLP) networks for a short term prediction in terms of the mean square error.

We adopt a new methodology that estimates elasticity in a multivariate setting that explicitly accommodates the correlations that exist between various yield factors. Results show that significant correlations exist between the residuals of yield factors and that such correlations do indeed impact on model estimates. Within the multivariate setting, the level of the short rate is shown to be a crucial determinant of the conditional volatility of all three yield factors.

Based on prior research, whereas the ""auditor learning"" argument predicts that audit quality will change in only one direction (i.e., improve) with tenure, the ""auditor-client closeness"" argument suggests that audit quality may decrease beyond some (albeit unspecified) length of tenure because of impaired auditor independence and objectivity. Consistent with prior theoretical arguments, we find some evidence of a nonlinear relation between audit firm tenure and the ex ante equity risk premium, that is, we find that the equity risk premium decreases in the early years of tenure but increases with additional years of tenure. These findings persist after we control for well-known risk factors and company characteristics that have been shown in prior research to be related to the cost of equity capital.

These are benchmarked against more traditional forecasting techniques to ascertain their potential as a forecasting tool and their economic value as a base for a trading decision tool. The models were developed using data from the UK Gilt market, US T-Bond market and German Bund market. Using in-sample data from April 2001to January 2003to develop the models, their results were assessed using the out-of-sample period of January 2003 to June 2003. Performance evaluation was based upon forecasting accuracy measures and financial criteria using a simulated trading strategy incorporating realistic trading costs. It is concluded that for the time series studied and for the period under investigation, the performance of the advanced models is mixed. While the NNR models have the ability to forecast the 10-year Government bond yield and add economic value as a trading decision tool, the Kalman filter models' performance is not as conclusive.

An excerpt from the Executive Summary of the Stern Review, concerned with the nature and magnitude of the deleterious economic consequences of anticipated climate change, is printed below. The principal scientific reviews of knowledge of climate change, its consequences, and mitigation strategies are the (roughly) quinquennial reports of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) - the work of hundreds of lead authors, subjected in turn to elaborate peer review and line-by-line scrutiny by interested governments. They represent a broad, though not total, expert consensus. The third IPCC assessment was issued in 2001; the fourth, already in draft, will be released next year. The Stern Review draws heavily on this scientific underpinning, but goes further than the IPCC exercise in computing economic values for the projected changes and costing out remedial policy responses. More forthright in style and emphatic in its conclusions, it reads as a resounding call to international action. The Review explores the implications of atmospheric concentrations of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases being capped at 550ppm (parts per million), double the preindustrial level, an objective it argues is feasible. That concentration would be reached by 2050 at current emission rates, or by 2035 if emissions rise as expected. The resulting warming, it believes, would be 2-5°C, roughly in accord with the IPCC's third-assessment estimates (see the Documents section of PDR 27, no. 1 for the IPCC projections). The positive feedbacks identified in some recent studies, generated by processes such as release of methane from permafrost, could lead to still higher temperatures. The forecast effects described are by now familiar, though no less grim for being so: species extinctions, expanding disease zones, reductions in surface water availability, coastal flooding, ocean acidification, and so on. The Review translates these effects into economic losses, adjusting for risk, using Monte Carlo simulation applied to an integrated assessment model (the so-called PAGE 2002 model). The exercise, requiring many heroic - and often contestable - assumptions, produces the most quoted figures in the report: that climate change ""will reduce welfare by an amount equivalent to a reduction in consumption per head of between 5 and 20%"" - now and into the future. The absolute magnitude of those projected economic losses is made arbitrarily large by their permanence. Typical benefit-cost calculations applied to appraisal of development projects convert such long-term trajectories into a present value using a discount rate comparable to a market interest rate or some (lower) assumed rate of time preference. The Stern Review, however, argues that any discounting is ethically inappropriate for this global issue: ""if a future generation will be present, we suppose that it has the same claim on our ethical attention as the current one"" (p. 31). The only exception is an allowance for the possibility that future generations are not present - through human extinction - which is held to justify a minuscule discount rate of 0.1 percent per annum (p. 161). The percentage economic losses from climate change appear less daunting if set against the recent pace of expansion in the world economy. Real per capita income growth since 1990 has averaged about 1.5 percent per year worldwide, and about 3 percent in developing countries. In such a regime, a 5 percent one-time drop to a lower expansion path is no more than a two- or three-year delay in attaining a given income level. For China and India, whose economies are doubling in size each decade, even a 20 percent reduction in income would be a mere hiccough on the path to affluence - hardly enough to motivate major shifts in lifestyle ambitions. The dire repercussions on global environments of a greenhouse warming at the upper end of the forecast range are poorly captured by those percentages. Demography has a marginal place in the Review. The underlying IPCC emission scenarios incorporate expected population growth, using the UN medium projections. Many of the climate-change effects incur costs that are similarly magnified by population growth. One-sixth of the world's population is ""threatened"" by water scarcities; 1 in 20 people may be displaced by a rising sea level; mortality may increase from vector-borne diseases and from malnutrition linked to income losses. The later part of the Review is concerned with mitigation and adaptation strategies. It lays out an ambitious set of policies for transition to a low-carbon economy that could stabilize greenhouse gas concentrations over the next several decades. By 2050, emissions would have to be 25 percent below today's and emissions per unit of GDP 75 percent below. In perhaps the most problematic part of the exercise the Review asserts that such cuts could be achieved at a cost of only around 1 percent of annual global GDP - implying that investment in mitigation should be strongly favored on straightforward economic grounds. (This figure, like others in the Review, is acknowledged to lie within a substantial envelope of uncertainty - here a range of -1.0 percent to +3.5 percent of global GDP (p. 212), or, drawing on a wider range of models, -4 percent to +15 percent (p. 241).) In the decades before the investment pays off, adverse consequences of the warming trends already underway must be dealt with by adaptation, such as through better disaster preparedness, lessening the vulnerability of infrastructure, and risk-pooling measures.

To ensure representative production functions, this region was divided into three relatively homogenous study areas, namely Central Zone, Mendefera and Dekemhare. Most data for the study were collected in a survey of 120 respondents using a structured questionnaire. To obviate the problem of multicollinearity among explanatory variables, ridge regression was used to estimate milk production functions for each study area. Production elasticities of variable inputs, marginal products (MPx), values of marginal products (VMPx), marginal rates of input substitution (MRS) and leastcost combinations of purchased concentrates and forage were estimated for the three regions. The VMPs of all inputs for Central Zone dairy farmer respondents were estimated to be greater than their input prices, implying that the resources were under-utilized from a profit-maximising perspective (i.e. where VMPx = Px). However, respondents in Mendefera and Dekemhare used concentrates in excess of optimum levels (i.e. VMPx < Px). Analysis of the least-cost combination of purchased concentrates and forage suggests that dairy farmer respondents were also not allocating these resources on a minimum-cost basis. However, the profit maximizing and least-cost criteria assume perfect knowledge, a risk-free environment and competitive markets. Improved information, farmer training and better infrastructure (roads and telecommunications) to promote competitive markets could help to enhance resource allocation decisions by dairy producers. © 2013 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-84887173439"

The approach in this paper is motivated by some recent theoretical literature on the limits to speculation and hysteresis. The paper estimates Logistic Smooth Transition Dynamic Regression (LSTR) models with a variety of transition variables, including the lagged forward premium, monetary and income fundamentals and also variables associated with time varying risk premium, including the conditional variances of some fundamentals. Results are reported for nine different currencies. Many of the estimated LSTR models provide evidence for the existence of an outer regime that is consistent with UIP. Estimation of the standard forward premium regression on observations falling in these regimes across the sample is moderately supportive of UIP holding in the outer regime. A simulation experiment also suggests that an LSTR dgp can produce data consistent with the anomaly. However, parameter estimation issues leads to considerable uncertainty with the estimated transition functions and hence imprecise definitions of regimes. The results are an interesting step in the direction of understanding the nonlinear dimension of the problem without fully resolving the anomaly. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

Under these stability conditions, the difference between the two series exhibits threshold-type nonlinearity. It is possible to construct a threshold error correction model from the min-max processes. Neglected nonlinearity tests are applied, both to the univariate series and to the bivariate system, in order to detect nonlinearity, and it turns out that the tests using the bivariate series have better power. We apply the min-max model to U.S. Treasury bills and commercial paper interest rates. The spread of these interest rates shows threshold-type nonlinearity, and this model outperforms a linear model in terms of its predictability for out-of-sample data. © 2005 Elsevier B.V.

A wide range of financial institutions is employed to test the hypothesis that the interest rate risk is priced by capital markets. In addition, the above sample is extended by incorporating firms from the non-financial sector. A two-factor model with the market portfolio and the changes in market yields, as exogenously specified risk variables, is employed. The model is estimated via a seemingly unrelated regression estimation (SURE) framework with both cross-equation restrictions and within equation nonlinear constraints on the parameters. The findings indicate that financial institutions' equity returns incorporate a risk premium for their exposure to market yields' surprises. The return generating function of the insurance business could be further explained by an additional factor such as currency movements. It is also empirically supported that the market premium drops out from the estimation process. When commercial and industrial firms are included in the estimation process, the findings unveil a reduction in the magnitude of the interest rate risk premium. © 2005 Taylor & Francis Group Ltd. © 2008 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","","capital market; interest rate","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-17744384695"

In each period each group formulates its demand for the risky assets and the risk-free asset according to myopic mean-variance maximizazion. The market consists of two types of agents: fundamentalists, who hold an estimate of the fundamental values of the risky assets and whose demand for each asset is a function of the deviation of the current price from the fundamental, and chartists, a group basing their trading decisions on an analysis of past returns. The time evolution of the prices is modelled by assuming the existence of a market maker, who sets excess demand of each asset to zero at the end of each trading period by taking an offsetting long or short position, and who announces the next period prices as functions of the excess demand for each asset and with a view to long-run market stability. The model is reduced to a seven-dimensional nonlinear discrete-time dynamical system, that describes the time evolution of prices and agents' beliefs about expected returns, variances and correlation. The unique steady state of the model is determined and the local asymptotic stability of the equilibrium is analysed, as a function of the key parameters that characterize agents' behaviour. In particular it is shown that when chartists update their expectations sufficiently fast, then the stability of the equilibrium is lost through a supercritical Neimark-Hopf bifurcation, and self-sustained price fluctuations along an attracting limit cycle appear in one or both markets. Global analysis is also performed, by using numerical techniques, in order to understand the role played by the chartists' behaviour in the transition to a regime characterized by irregular oscillatory motion and coexistence of attractors. It is also shown how changes occurring in one market may affect the price dynamics of the alternative risky asset, as a consequence of the dynamic updating of agents' portfolios. © 2005 Taylor & Francis Group Ltd. © 2005 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-16644376238"

We respond with development and testing of a framework using partisan and opportunistic political business cycle (PBC) theory to predict the investment risk perceived by investors holding sovereign bonds during 19 presidential elections in 12 developing countries from 1994 to 2000. Consistent with our framework, we find that bondholders perceive higher (lower) investment risk in the form of higher (lower) credit spreads on their sovereign bonds as right-wing (left-wing) political incumbents appear more likely to be replaced by left-wing (right-wing) challengers. For international business research, our findings illustrate the promise of PBC theory in explaining the election-period behavior of sovereign bondholders and, perhaps, other investors who also 'vote' in developing country elections and can substantially influence the price and availability of capital there. For developing country investors and states, our findings highlight the financial effects of democracy in action, and underscore the importance of state communication with investors during election periods. © 2005 Palgrave Macmillan Ltd.

When cointegration is not modelled, evidence is found of both linear and nonlinear causality between cash prices and analysed predictor variables. However, after controlling for cointegration, evidence of significant nonlinear causality is no longer found. These results contribute to the empirical literature on commodity price forecasting by highlighting the relationship between cointegration and detectable linear and nonlinear causality. The importance of interest rate and inventory as well as futures price in forecasting cash prices is also illustrated. Failure to detect significant nonlinearity after controlling for cointegration may also go some way to explaining the reason for the disappointing forecasting performances of many nonlinear models in the general finance literature.

By observing how markets respond to well-defined exogenous shocks (such as the shock of 11 September 2001) we are able to determine how investors organize their ""flight to safety"": which safe haven they select, how long their collective panic lasts, and so on. As rebounds come to an end the correlation of stock and bond prices fades away, a clear sign that the collective behavior of investors loses some of its coherence; this observation can be used as an objective criterion for assessing the end of a market rebound.

The results provide strong evidence against all of the macro factors considered with the exception of exchange rate changes and, consistent with the existing literature, provide strong support for several financial factors, but not beta, as significant predictors of excess returns. © 2004 Published by Elsevier B.V. © 2018 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Bayesian model selection; Emerging markets; Macroeconomic factors","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-10644293253"

The model explains accepted loan applications and simultaneously determines loan sizes and interest rates. A competitive and a discriminating monopoly version of the model are proposed. Offered interest rates and loan sizes are a function of observable borrower characteristics. The competitive model rests on a marginal condition, reflecting contract optimality, to which a zero-profit condition is added. In contrast, the discriminating monopoly maximizes profits under a borrower participation constraint, reflecting the availability of a rental market as an outside option. Each version of the model is a bivariate, nonlinear model, and is estimated by standard maximum likelihood methods. The data used for estimation is a sample of clients of a French network of mortgage lenders. We show the presence of ""social discrimination"" in the data, the loan conditions depending not only on the borrower's wage and down payment, but also on the borrower's occupational status. Abnormally high risk premia in the competitive version of the model suggest the presence of market power, justifying an attempt at estimating its monopolistic version. The discriminating monopoly model estimates show that the borrowers' price-elasticity of demand for housing varies with occupational status, and is inversely related with the lender's interest rate markups. This confirms that the lender exploits structural differences in the preferences to discriminate, as predicted by standard theories. © 2003 Elsevier B.V.

Term structure dynamics appear to exhibit pronounced time varying or stochastic volatility. Ahn et al. (Rev. Financial Stud. xx (2001) xxx) provide evidence suggesting that term structure models incorporating a set of quadratic factors are better able to reproduce term structure dynamics than affine models, although neither class of models is able to fully capture term structure volatility. In this study, we combine affine, quadratic and non-linear factors in order to maximize the ability of a term structure model to generate heteroskedastic volatility. We show that this combination entails a tradeoff between specification of heteroskedastic volatility and correlations among the factors. By combining factors, we are able to gauge the cost of this tradeoff. Using efficient method of moments (Gallant and Tauchen, Econometric Theory 12 (1996) 657), we find that augmenting a quadratic model with a non-linear factor results in improvement in fit over a model comprised solely of quadratic factors when the model only has to confront first and second moment dynamics. When the full dynamics are confronted, this result reverses. Since the non-linear factor is characterized by stronger dependence of volatility on the level of the factor, we conclude that flexibility in the specification of both level dependence and correlation structure of the factors are important for describing term structure dynamics. © 2003 Elsevier B.V.

We propose a model of equity price dynamics that allows for (i) simultaneous consideration of multiple stock prices, (ii) analytical formulas for derivatives such as futures, options and bonds, and (iii) a realistic description of all of these assets. The analytical specification of the model allows us to infer the dynamics of the pricing kernel. The model, calibrated to a comprehensive dataset including the S&P 500 index, individual equities, T-bills and gold futures, yields the conditional filter of the unobservable pricing kernel. As a result we obtain the estimate of the kernel that is positive almost surely (i.e. precludes arbitrage), consistent with the equity risk premium, the risk-free discounting, and with the observed asset prices by construction. The pricing kernel estimate involves a highly nonlinear function of the contemporaneous and lagged returns on the S&P 500 index. This contradicts typical implementations of CAPM that use a linear function of the market proxy return as the pricing kernel. Hence, the S&P 500 index does not have to coincide with the market portfolio if it is used in conjunction with nonlinear asset pricing models. We also find that our best estimate of the pricing kernel is not consistent with the standard time-separable utilities, but potentially could be cast into the stochastic habit formation framework of Campbell and Cochrane (J.

In particular, investors should consider in their real estate return models the predictability of the gilt-equity yield ratio in Belgium, the Netherlands and France, and the term structure of interest rates in France. Predictions obtained from the VAR and univariate time-series models are compared with the predictions of an artificial neural network model.

Joint probability estimates based on the analysis of multistage chance trees are more likely than not to be below the true probability of adverse events, but will sometimes substantially overestimate them. In contexts such as insurance markets for environmental risks, skewed distributions of risk estimates amplify the ""winner's curse"" so that the estimated risk premium for low-probability events is likely to be lower than the normative value. Skewness may result even in unbiased estimators of expected value from simple lotteries, if measurement error is associated with both the probability and pay-off terms. Further, skewness may occur even if the error associated with these two estimates is symmetrically distributed. Under certain circumstances, skewed estimates of expected value may result in risk-neutral decisionmakers exhibiting a tendency to choose a certainty equivalent over a lottery of equal expected value, or vice versa. We show that when distributions of estimates of expected value are positively skewed, under certain circumstances it will be optimal to choose lotteries with nominal values lower than the value of apparently superior certainty equivalents. Extending the previous work of Goodman (1960), we provide an exact formula for the skewness of products. © 2008 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Decision analysis; Distribution of products; Measurement error; Probabilistic risk analysis; Skewness","Decision making; Error analysis; Probability; Skewed distributions; Risk assessment; error analysis; measurement method; risk assessment; statistical analysis; analytical error; article; biostatistics; calculation; decision making; mathematical model; measurement","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-0036093310"

This parametrization results from letting the volatility function depend on time to maturity and on two factors: the instantaneous spot rate and one fixed-maturity forward rate. Our main purpose is an estimation methodology for which we have to model the observations under the historical probability measure. This leads us to consider as an additional third factor the market price of interest rate risk, that connects the historical and the HJM martingale measures. Assuming that the information comes from noisy observations of the fixed-maturity forward rate, the purpose is to estimate recursively, on the basis of this information, the three Markovian factors as well as the parameters in the model, in particular those in the volatility function. This leads to a nonlinear filtering problem, for the solution of which we describe an approximation methodology, based on time discretization and quantization. We prove the convergence of the approximate filters for each of the observed trajectories. © 2005 Elsevier Science B.V., Amsterdam.

FOFs investment mainly consists of hedge fund investment and it has two major characteristics which are low correlation against benchmark index and little impact from various external changes in the environment given maximizing return. According to the historical track record of survival hedge funds in this business world, they maintain a stable high return and low risk. However, one must keep in mind that low risk would not be equal to risk free. The failure of Long-term capital management (LTCM) that took place in the summer of 1998 was a symbolized phenomenon. The summer of 1998 exhibited a certain limitation of traditional value at risk (VaR) and some possibility that traditional VaR could be ineffectual to the nonlinear type of fluctuation in the market. In this paper, I try to bring self-organized criticality (SOC) into portfolio risk control. SOC would be well known as a model of decay in the natural world. I analyzed nonlinear type of fluctuation in the market as SOC and applied SOC to capture complicated market movement using threshold point of SOC and risk adjustments by scenario correlation as implicit signals. Threshold becomes the control parameter of risk exposure to set downside floor and forecast extreme nonlinear type of fluctuation under a certain probability. Simulation results would show synergy effect of portfolio risk control between SOC and absolute return strategy. © 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.

It differs from recent papers investigating analogous issues because it uses Nelson's result that Garch schemes are approximations of the kind of differential equations typically employed in finance to describe the evolution of asset prices. This feature of Garch schemes usually has been overshadowed by their well-known role as simple econometric tools providing reliable estimates of unobserved conditional variances. We show instead that the diffusion approximation property of Garch gives good results and can be extended to situations with (i) non-standard distributions for the innovations of a conditional mean equation of asset price changes and (ii) volatility concepts different from the variance. The objective PDF of the asset price is recovered from the estimation of a nonlinear Garch fitted to the historical path of the asset price.

By Duffie and Singleton model, yield spread was explained by two factors, namely collection rate and default probability. An estimation of the collection rate is given from historical earnings data, but estimation of default probability is known to be a remaining problem. There are some approaches to express default probability. One of them is to describe it through hazard process, and the other is to represent it by risk neutral transition probability matrix of credit-rating class. Some models that use Gaussian type hazard process or Vasicek type hazard process have already constructed. An advantage of evaluation using a rating transition probability matrix is that it is easy to obtain an image of movement of the credit-rating class. We do not need to show the calculation basis of the threshold or an assumption for distribution of prospective yield spread. But the model that uses the risk neutral transition probability matrix has not established yet, because of the computational difficulty required to estimate large number of the parameters. At first, for the purposes of this article, we will estimate the term structure of credit spreads results from the possibility of future defaults. It is assumed that credit risk is specified as a discrete-state Markov chain. And we construct a model which can be used to estimate the baseline transition matrix of the credit-rating class, risk-adjusting factors, industrial drift factors, corporate drift factors and recovery ratio, from yield spreads for individual bond. This enables us to compute the implied term structure from market data. We are capable of computing the implied term structure from market date by this process. Next, we will provide a valuation model for the term structure of yield spread. © 2001 Kluwer Academic Publishers. © 2018 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Automatic differentiation; Nonlinear programming; Transition matrix of credit-rating class; Yield spread","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-52549092985"

I develop a nonlinear asymmetric framework that allows for comparisons of non-nested models featuring conditional heteroskedasticity and sensitivity of the volatility process to interest rate levels. A new class of stochastic volatility models with asymmetric drift and nonlinear asymmetric diffusion process is introduced in discrete time and tested against the popular continuous time and symmetric and asymmetric GARCH models. The existing models are rejected in favor of the newly proposed models because of the asymmetric drift of the short rate, and the presence of nonlinearity, asymmetry, GARCH, and level effects in its volatility. I test the predictive power of nested and non-nested models in capturing the stochastic behavior of the risk-free rate.

The two-regime Markov-switch model that we used as a nonlinear filter allows the dynamic behavior of the economy to vary between expansions and recessions in terms of duration and volatility. We found that the bank term structure, the public term structure, and the spread based on the call rate predicted all recessions with a comfortable lead, although they lagged some of the recoveries by a few months. The bank-public spread generates a series of false signals, and missed completely the upturn in the mid-1970s, but detected the last two recoveries with an average lead of nearly 12 months. The source of the predictive power of interest rate spreads lies in the information they contain not only about monetary policy, but also about an assortment of general macroeconomic shocks. The filter probabilities from three of the interest rate differentials also foreshadowed the long swings in the German inflation rate remarkably well, with a lead time of 2-4 years without any false signals. © International Institute of Forecasters. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Bundesbank policy; Germany; Markov-switch model; Term structure; Turning-point forecasts","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-0010061067"

Standard statistical tests for randomness, such as autocorrelation tests, have low power against a large class of deterministic, nonlinear processes. Discerning nonrandomness of innovations in exchange rates is important for a variety of reasons. For example, many models of international asset pricing assume exchange rates to follow a random walk. Furthermore, nonlinear patterns in deviations from various exchange rate parities have implications for the existence of a time-varying foreign exchange risk premium. With the use of the BDS statistic and a correlation dimension analysis, this paper's primary findings are that (1) foreign exchange markets have become increasingly complex and therefore less amenable to forecasting over time; (2) although forward exchange risk premia are statistically significant and display a deterministic structure, this structure is complex and therefore not easily discernible; and (3) innovations in real exchange rates are consistent with a Purchasing Power Parity equilibrium. © 1999 Elsevier Science Inc. © 2018 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","BDS statistic; Correlation dimension; Nonlinear dependence; Random walk","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-0042597353"

However, this paper shows that they can successfully be used when the purpose of the time series study is to provide forecasts. A projection scheme inspired from projection pursuit regression and feedforward artificial neural networks is used in order to avoid an explosion of the number of parameters when considering a large number of lags. The estimation of the parameters of the projected polynomial autoregressions is a non-linear least-squares problem. A consistency result is proved. A simulation study shows that the naive use of the common final prediction error criterion is inappropriate to identify the best projected polynomial autoregression. An explanation of this phenomenon is given and a correction to the criterion is proposed. An important feature of the polynomial predictors introduced in this paper is their simple implementation, which allows for automatic use.

Overfitted networks have poor generalization capabilities. We explore two methods that attempt to overcome this shortcoming by reducing the complexity of the network. The results of our experiments confirm that an ""overfitted"" network, while making better predictions for within-sample data, makes poor predictions for out-of-sample data. The methods for reducing the complexity of the network, explored in this paper, clearly help improve out-of-sample forecasts.

However, a major weakness of neural modeling is the lack of established procedures for performing tests for misspecified models, and tests of statistical significance for the various parameters that have been estimated. This is a serious disadvantage in applications where there is a strong culture for testing not only the predictive power of a model or the sensitivity of the dependent variable to changes in the inputs but also the statistical significance of the finding at a specified level of confidence. Rarely is this more important than in the case of financial engineering, where the data generating processes are dominantly stochastic and only partially deterministic. Partly a tutorial, partly a review, this paper describes a collection of typical applications in options pricing, cointegration, the term structure of interest rates and models of investor behavior which highlight these weaknesses and propose and evaluate a number of solutions. We describe a number of alternative ways to deal with the problem of variable selection, show how to use model misspecification tests, we deploy a novel way based on cointegration to deal with the problem of nonstationarity, and generally describe approaches to predictive neural modeling which are more in tune with the requirements for modeling financial data series. © 1997 IEEE. © 2011 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Cointegration; Computational finance; Financial engineering; Model identification; Model selection; Neural networks; Variable selection; Volatility; Yield curve","Computational methods; Computer simulation; Economics; Estimation; Fees and charges; Financial data processing; Management science; Mathematical models; Random processes; Sensitivity analysis; Statistical methods; Active asset management; Cointegration; Financial engineering; Interest rates; Investment; Pricing; Neural networks","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-0031272644"

However, almost no attention has been directed at intermediate-term interest rate yields, that is yields on bonds maturing more than one year and less than ten years in the future. Also, this literature essentially ignores the second half of the 1980s and the 1990s. Accordingly, this note empirically investigates the impact of budget deficits in the US on the interest rate yield on three-year US Treasury notes for the period 1960 through the end of 1994. Based on OLS and IV estimates, two of which include net international capital inflows, it is found that budget deficits do raise intermediate-term rates, which may strengthen arguments that budget deficits lead to crowding out. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-5844313200"

Nonlinear error correction arises because portfolio adjustment is an 'on-off' process, which occurs only when disequilibrium in the bill market is large enough to induce investors to incur the transaction costs associated with buying/selling bills. This, together with heterogeneity of transaction costs, implies that the strength of aggregate error correction depends on both the distribution of costs and the extent of disequilibrium in the market. Smooth transition models are used to describe an aggregate adjustment process which is strong when the market is distant from equilibrium, but becomes weaker as the market approaches equilibrium. Linearity tests indicate that the types of nonlinearities that would be induced by transactions costs are statistically significant, and estimated models which incororate these nonlinearities outperform their linear counterparts, both in sample and out of sample. © Blackwell Publishers 1997. © 2018 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-0031523523"

This paper introduces an approach which generates a nonlinear strategy that explicitly maximizes the Sharpe Ratio. It is expressed as a neural network model whose output is the position size between a risky and a risk-free asset. The iterative parameter update rules are derived and compared to alternative approaches. The resulting trading strategy is evaluated and analyzed on both computer-generated data and real world data (DAX, the daily German equity index). Trading based on Sharpe Ratio maximization compares favorably to both profit optimization and probability matching (through cross-entropy optimization). The results show that the goal of optimizing out-of-sample risk-adjusted profit can indeed be achieved with this nonlinear approach.

Given these implications, we employ a nonparametric estimation technique to document the empirical relation between the risk premium and the slope of the term structure using almost two hundred years of data. Of particular interest, the risk premium is increasing in the term structure slope; however, for either small or negative slopes, the risk premium is much more sensitive to changes in interest rates. In addition, the empirical results imply negative expected equity risk premiums for some inverted term structures. Finally, variations in the risk premium do not appear to be related to variations in the variance of equity returns.

An APT model is estimated as a restricted nonlinear multivariate regression system using seven macroeconomic variables, various residual market factor (RMF) proxies, and the returns on fifty size related portfolios of equities that traded on the Toronto Stock Exchange (TSE). As in Chen, Roll and Ross (1986), five macrofactors (lagged industrial production, lagged GDP, term structure, unexpected inflation, and risk premium) have significantly priced risk premia. The risk premia are insignificant for RMF based on two value weighted indices, and marginally significant (0.10 level) for the RMF based on an equally weighted index, which is somewhat consistent with McElroy and Burmeister (1988) and Brown and Otsuki (1989). The significance of the RMF risk premium appears not to be robust to whether portfolios or individual securities are used in the estimations. The significance of the estimated risk premia for the macrofactors also appear not to be robust to the number of portfolios (equations) used in the estimations. Unlike the risk premia estimates for the RMF, those for the other macrofactors are generally unaffected by the inclusion of a January dummy.

If over-reaction does occur and prices overshoot then there should be a subsequent revision in the opposite direction. This paper outlines empirical research into the over-reaction hypothesis on the Johannesburg Stock Exchange using data over the period July 1974 to June 1989 for two hundred and four relatively well traded securities. The results are consistent with the over-reaction hypothesis and indicate substantial weak form inefficiencies in the South African stock market in the long-term. The performance of portfolios of shares formed on the basis of prior return data can be predicted and, on average, portfolios of prior ‘losers’ outperformed prior ‘winners’ by about twenty percent over the three years after portfolio formation. Finally, comparison between the empirical results and a similar study for the New York Stock Exchange calls into some question the hypothesis that exceptionally large returns in January in the USA are due to investor tax loss selling. There is evidence of both a January effect and an asymmetric excess returns effect for the South African market but it is less pronounced than for the American market. © 1992, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

The conditioning information used for the nonparametric analysis is that implied by the theoretical model of time-varying risk. Thus, the kernel estimator is used, in conjunction with a nonparametric diagnostic test for in-sample residual nonlinear structure, to assess the adequacy of the parametric model in capturing any structure in the excess returns. Our results support the parametric specification of an asset pricing model in which the conditional beta is the ratio of the relevant components of the conditional covariance matrix of returns modelled as a bivariate generalized ARCH process. Although the predictable component of the conditional moments is relatively small, the parametric estimator of the risk premia has somewhat more out-of-sample forecasting ability than does the kernel estimator. Hence, the superior in-sample performance of the latter may be attributed to overfitting. © 1992. © 2014 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-0011463942"

In a forecast, which relies heavily on exports to stimulate demand in 1992, the Treasury cannot regard the rising probability of renewed recession in the US or the very sharp slowdown currently taking place in Europe as the post‐unification German boom runs out of steam with equanimity. The fear mist remain in Conservative politicians' minds that there will be no meaningful recovery within an electorally significant timescale. We sketch out this background, but our focus here is not on the prospects for recovery; rather we ask whether the recession has achieved its objectives. The recession was, it should be remembered, the direct product of government policy ‐ interest rates were raised to 15per cent ahead of ERM membership ‐ aimed at reversing the excesses of the late 198Os'boom and in particular at bringing inflation quickly down to acceptable European levels and reducing the deficit on the current account, which at its peak in 1989 amounted to 4 per cent of GDP. Our answer is that, over the last year of recession, considerable progress has been made: the rate of inflation is now in line with that in Germany and the current account deficit has fallen to under 1 per cent of GDP. But, on the government's own forecasts contained in the Autumn Statement, there will be some slippage on both counts in 1992. It is this worrying feature that we consider here. Our overall conclusion is that the recession has not completely delivered its objectives and that, even as the politicians turn their attention to recovery, we still have to fight yesterday's battles.

The results indicate that although the estimated coefficient of coskewness gives important information on the marginal rate of substitution between skewness and expected return, the elasticity coefficient can provide additional (albeit different) information on skewness preference that is independent of the effects of the market risk premium. This research also shows how the non‐linear formulation provides a direct linkage between the twomoment and three‐moment CAPM versions and thus provides an empirical test of the theoretical conditions under which skewness preference is consistent with the two‐moment CAPM empiricial results.

In fact the sharp fall in the sterling price of oil has provided him with the perfect excuse for not making significant cuts in personal income tax that were largely irrelevant to the needs of the economy. Instead of a boost to household demand we have had, thanks to OPEC, a transfer to companies in the form of a reduction in costs. This should enable them to expand output against a background of falling inflation. Our post‐Budget assessment of macroeconomic prospects (Section I), made on the Treasury's assumption of a $15 oil price, shows output growing by 2 1/2 per cent this year and inflation falling below 3 per cent in 1987. We are thus less optimistic than the Treasury about output but more optimistic about inflation. How was the Chancellor able, within the confines of the Medium‐Term Financial Strategy, to give anything away having lost so much oil revenue? A detailed analysis of the PSBR forecast (Section II) reveals good reasons why non‐oil tax revenues should be some £3 1/2n higher than forecast this time last year. But, because we still expect public spending to be above the official figures, our PSBR forecast is £1bn higher than the Treasury's. Although the macroeconomic impact of the Budget was small (especially in relation to that of the fall in oil prices which preceded it), it continued the process of tax reform. We focus, in Section III, on the new proposals to deal with the problem of the pension fund surpluses to which we drew attention in the November issue of Financial Outlook. We conclude that the proposed measures could have a larger effect on tax revenues in the longer term than is indicated by the Treasury's Budget estimates. Copyright © 1986, Wiley Blackwell.
