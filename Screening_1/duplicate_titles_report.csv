Nonlinear predictability of stock returns using financial and economic variables,"Inspired by the linear predictability and nonlinearity found in the finance literature, this article examines the nonlinear predictability of the excess returns. The relationship between the excess returns and the predicting variables is recursively modeled by a neural-network model, which is capable of performing flexible nonlinear functional approximation. The nonlinear neural-network model is found to have better in-sample fit and out-of-sample forecasts compared to its linear counterpart. Moreover, the switching portfolio based on the recursive neural-network forecasts generates higher profits with lower risks than both the buy-and-hold market portfolio and the switching portfolio based on linear recursive forecasts. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Qi, M.",1999,10.1080/07350015.1999.10524830,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-0033435319&doi=10.1080%2F07350015.1999.10524830&partnerID=40&md5=5168aa09c44a851bad6e254e59934493,scopus,True

On filtering in Markovian term structure models: An approximation approach,"We consider a parametrization of the Heath-Jarrow-Morton (HJM) family of term structure of interest rate models that allows a finite-dimensional Markovian representation of the stochastic dynamics. This parametrization results from letting the volatility function depend on time to maturity and on two factors: the instantaneous spot rate and one fixed-maturity forward rate. Our main purpose is an estimation methodology for which we have to model the observations under the historical probability measure. This leads us to consider as an additional third factor the market price of interest rate risk, that connects the historical and the HJM martingale measures. Assuming that the information comes from noisy observations of the fixed-maturity forward rate, the purpose is to estimate recursively, on the basis of this information, the three Markovian factors as well as the parameters in the model, in particular those in the volatility function. This leads to a nonlinear filtering problem, for the solution of which we describe an approximation methodology, based on time discretization and quantization. We prove the convergence of the approximate filters for each of the observed trajectories. © 2005 Elsevier Science B.V., Amsterdam.
